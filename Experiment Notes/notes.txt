Task 1


Task 2
- TFIDF SVM perform better than neural model on F1 Bandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum
- Overall Bert-large out of the box has best over micro-f1 but generally poor 
performance per class
- Adding self attention after a transformer layer greatly increases training time
and is quite expensive.
