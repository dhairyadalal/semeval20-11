0,832916508,Dems in Congress Demand Barr Release Full Mueller Report ‘Without Delay’
1,832916508,"Democrats on six House committees—including Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Oversight chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD), and Intelligence chair Adam Schiff (D-CA)—are demanding that the Justice Department release Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report “without delay.” According to the Associated Press, the Democrats said they expect Attorney General William Barr to turn over all the evidence Mueller has collected in his probe into potential Russian collusion in the 2016 election."
2,832916508,"If not, the lawmakers said it “would raise serious questions about whether the Department of Justice policy is being used as a pretext for a cover-up of misconduct.” The hashtag “#ReleaseTheReport” was also utilized on Twitter among Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who warned Barr against giving President Trump or members of his legal team a “sneak preview.”"
3,832916508,"Earlier Friday, the AP reported that Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said the president’s lawyers wanted an early look at Mueller’s findings before they were made public."
4,832916508,"Giuliani later disputed that reporting in comments to The Daily Beast, saying the matter “will be handled properly” and it’s “up to DOJ.” The White House had earlier issued a statement saying it was looking “forward” to the next steps after Mueller handed in his report and noting that the administration “has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”"

6,787966255,"Dallas, TX — On Sunday, activists rallied around the Dallas Cowboy’s stadium to draw attention to the slaying of Botham Jean."
7,787966255,"They carried coffins and blocked traffic to expose the special treatment of Amber Guyger, the cop who has yet to even be fired for killing Jean."
8,787966255,"Now, as more details emerge, this special treatment has moved to a level that is even more insidious."

20,787966255,"From the beginning of this case, it was clear that Guyger was receiving special treatment from law enforcement."
21,787966255,"One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger’s “verbal commands.” Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this?"
22,787966255,"Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that “The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest."
23,787966255,"As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused."
24,787966255,"An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion."
25,787966255,This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.”
26,787966255,"What’s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger’s apartment."
27,787966255,"For those who don’t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean’s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body."
28,787966255,They attempted to assassinate Jean’s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment.
29,787966255,"However, they failed miserably at it."
30,787966255,"One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn’t release any information on what they found in Guyger’s apartment."
31,787966255,"According to the information currently available, that’s because they didn’t search it."
32,787966255,"According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case—none of which were for the killer’s apartment."
33,787966255,As WFAA reports:
34,787966255,"Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean’s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks."
35,787966255,An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks.
36,787966255,A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean’s apartment and collect additional evidence.
37,787966255,"A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted “laser measurements of firearm trajectory,” and collected “gunshot residue” from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean’s apartment."
38,787966255,A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management’s office.
39,787966255,"A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting."
40,787966255,"An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for “linear access doors and gates,” an “elevator access door lock” report and a “lock audit report for both apartments."
41,787966255,"Now, even if police would try to search the killer cop’s apartment, it’s too late."
42,787966255,"On Sunday, apartment staff notified residents in an email that Guyger “has vacated her apartment and no longer resides at our community.”"
43,787966255,"A manager at the complex declined to indicate exactly when Guyger moved out and if she left the premises voluntarily, the Dallas Morning News reports."
44,787966255,"While residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them, the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice."
45,787966255,"Mother of #BothamJean, Allison Jean, says the “smear” of her son is unacceptable."

48,789454337,Blue Privilege: Amber Guyger Free on Bail as Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail
49,789454337,"The case of Amber Guyger, the police officer who admitted to shooting 26-year-old Botham Jean in his apartment for no reason, is a glaring example of “blue privilege” at work in our society."
50,789454337,"Guyger claims that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and shot a man who she thought was a burglar, however, eyewitness testimony has contradicted her initial statement."
51,789454337,"Despite admitting to killing an innocent man and having her initial statement contradicted by witness testimony, Guyger has been treated as more of a victim than a killer."
52,789454337,"In fact, Guyger’s apartment was never even searched for evidence, and she was allowed to “vacate” the premises without any type of search."
53,789454337,"By not searching her apartment immediately, police ruined the investigation, making it harder to prosecute her."
54,789454337,It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it.

66,789454337,"Police claim to have found a very small amount of marijuana, which they attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing."
67,789454337,"It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment, not only did she get away without a search, but she turned herself in at her own convenience and was let out two hours later."
68,789454337,Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment if they just admitted to killing an innocent person.
69,789454337,"There has also been controversy over the fact that Guyger has been charged with manslaughter instead of murder, which will make it possible for her to receive a much short prison sentence."
70,789454337,"As Guyger walks free awaiting her trial, the 9 people who were arrested protesting the murder and Guyger’s special treatment are still sitting behind bars."
71,789454337,"After a ceremony for Botham Jean, the protesters were arrested for obstructing traffic."
72,789454337,"Attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Botham Jean’s family, posted an update about the injustice on Twitter."

79,789454337,"The officer who shot and killed Botham Jean remains on the Dallas police force and was able to bond out on manslaughter charges in a fraction of the time the protestors have spent in jail,” Merritt said in a statement."
80,789454337,Merrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail to send a message and make an example out of them.
81,789454337,"The reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves and keep one another in check."

84,738028498,Humanity’s WIPEOUT Foreshadowed?
85,738028498,World Health Chief: Global Pandemic Imminent
86,738028498,"According to a World Health Organization doctor, a global pandemic is imminent, and no one will be prepared for it when it hits."
87,738028498,"Dr. Tedros Adhanom, director-general for WHO, has said that the next outbreak that will hit us will be a “terrible” one, causing a large death all over the world."
88,738028498,"“Humanity is more vulnerable in the face of epidemics because we are much more connected and we travel around much more quickly than before,” said WHO specialist in infectious diseases Dr. Sylvie Brand."
89,738028498,"“We know that it is coming, but we have no way of stopping it,” said Brand."
90,738028498,"According to Dr. Tedros, the flu is extremely dangerous to everyone living on the planet."
91,738028498,"This fear was also promoted by experts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month."
92,738028498,The claims came exactly 100 years after the 1918 Spanish flu that claimed 50 million lives and killed three times as many people as World War I.
93,738028498,A mutated strain is the most likely contender to wipe out millions because it can join together with other strains to become deadlier.
94,738028498,“This is not some future nightmare scenario.
95,738028498,A devastating epidemic could start in any country at any time and kill millions of people because we are still not prepared.
96,738028498,The world remains vulnerable.
97,738028498,"We do not know where and when the next global pandemic will occur, but we know it will take a terrible toll both on human life and on the economy,” said Dr. Tedros."
98,738028498,“Hidden underneath this fear-mongering message of a global pandemic is a far more sinister W.H.O.
99,738028498,"agenda,” warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, publisher of Medicine.news."
100,738028498,"“The real agenda is a global push for blind, fear-based acceptance of unsafe, unproven vaccines that will be rolled out alongside the next global pandemic,” Adams warns."
101,738028498,"“Fear circumvents rational thinking, which is why the vaccine-pharma cartels routinely turn to irrational fear propaganda to demand absolute and unquestioning acceptance of risky medical interventions that should always be scrutinized for safety and efficacy.” –Natural News"
102,738028498,"Dr. Tedros’ comments come on the heels of the plague outbreak in Madagascar, which was the most recent epidemic to receive international aid attention amid fears it would spread."
103,738028498,"More than 200 people were killed during the outbreak that ravaged the island over the winter, which prompted 10 nearby African countries to be placed on high alert."
104,763114850,Who Is Behind the Internet Thought Police?
105,763114850,"An article, “What the Red Pill Means for Radicals,” published on June 7 in the ironically named publication Fair Observer might have passed unnoticed as yet another uninformed, biased and ideologically motivated attack on all who ever get labeled “extremists.” The piece is so riddled with non-sequiturs and wild generalizations that it seems almost cruel to rip it to shreds."
106,763114850,But the author is Bharath Ganesh.
107,763114850,A little online research reveals that Ganesh is currently working at the Oxford Internet Institute — at the esteemed Oxford University — on a research project funded by the European Union to devise ways to disrupt the “far right” online.
108,763114850,"The project in question is under the banner of the Vox-Pol Network of Excellence, which “is designed to comprehensively research, analyse, debate, and critique issues surrounding violent online political extremism (VOPE).”"
109,763114850,This research group is only interested in violent extremism – according to their website.
110,763114850,"“The qualifier ‘violent’ is therefore employed here to describe VOX-Pol’s interest, which is in those that employ or advocate physical violence against other individuals and groups to forward their political objectives."
111,763114850,"The extremist nature of the politics in which VOX-Pol is interested is thus not decided upon by project participants, but by the decision of those involved in particular types of politics to advocate or employ violence to advance their goals.”"

122,763114850,"Note the claims – utterly disingenuous, as it turns out – that the labeling of certain people or groups as “violent extremists” is entirely due to their own behavior; in other words, don’t worry, folks, it’s all scientifically objective."
123,763114850,"This research is being used to advise companies who host online platforms, such as Facebook, as well as governments, on how to stamp out online radicalization – using strategies such as working out ways of preventing people from seeing material posted that is deemed unsuitable in some way, or offering them alternative “nice” things to look at."
124,763114850,This is a seriously important issue.
125,763114850,The people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information.
126,763114850,They are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi.
127,763114850,But who guards the guardians?
128,763114850,"For if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask."
129,763114850,"One could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called “alt-right” and the “manosphere”; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations."
130,763114850,"(Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)"
131,763114850,And the label of “violent extremist” turns out to be used very generously.
132,763114850,Ganesh makes wild leaps and inferences.
133,763114850,"He talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque."
134,763114850,"This was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned."
135,763114850,"But why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh?"
136,763114850,The attack “was executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it.
137,763114850,"He found a narrative from British counter-jihad groups closely aligned with the alt-right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.” The British counter-jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh “knows” they encouraged him."
138,763114850,"The BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs."
139,763114850,Ganesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne’s mind.
140,763114850,"Rather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne’s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson."
141,763114850,Yet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence.
142,763114850,What “narrative from British counter-jihad groups” can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque?
143,763114850,"I’m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it."
144,763114850,But there is none offered – only surmise and Ganesh’s mindreading techniques.
145,763114850,"I suppose if you’re paid to fight online extremism, you’d better find it, or you’re out of a job and short of academic publication."
146,763114850,"We have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is “alt-right.” He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist – he’s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn’t like the infiltration by the far right."
147,763114850,He shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.
148,763114850,"The writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online."
149,763114850,We have to ask.
150,763114850,"Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a “researcher” who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson’s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?"
151,763114850,There’s more.
152,763114850,"Bharath Ganesh’s profile tells us this: “During his Ph.D., Bharath was also a Senior Researcher at Tell MAMA, a national project dedicated to mapping and monitoring anti-Muslim hate in the United Kingdom."
153,763114850,"He has given evidence in the Houses of Parliament on governance, extremism, gender, and hate crime and authored a number of reports in this area.”"
154,763114850,"Is it simply a coincidence that this “researcher,” prior to coming to Oxford University, worked for Tell Mama, that factory for the production of bogus claims about Islamophobia?"
155,763114850,Who runs the Internet runs the world.
156,763114850,"Is this a partnership between Europe’s governments, the Internet giants, and Islamic influence?"

174,789753303,The department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules.
175,789753303,Officer Guyger was terminated for her actions.
176,789753303,She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division.
177,789753303,"Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline."
178,789753303,This move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired.
179,789753303,"As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, “There is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger."
180,789753303,I don’t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.”
181,789753303,"Also, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law."
182,789753303,"“I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action."
183,789753303,"There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall."
184,789753303,"Apparently, it is no longer against the law."
185,789753303,This news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.
186,789753303,"As TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong."
187,789753303,"While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him."
188,789753303,This is a fact.
189,789753303,This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.
190,789753303,"Because of her actions, this man no longer lives."
191,789753303,This alone should have been enough to fire her.
192,789753303,"Surprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, “Good,” showing her support for the move."
193,789753303,"For those who don’t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today."
194,789753303,"Indeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George’s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment."
195,789753303,He shot two officers.
196,789753303,"Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized."

248,761575506,Former President Bill Clinton said his public apology for his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was enough.
249,761575506,"NBC’s “Today” show correspondent Craig Melvin asked Clinton in an interview aired Monday if he had ever apologized to Lewinsky, who was 22 and Clinton’s subordinate when they began an affair more than two decades ago."
250,761575506,"“I apologized to everybody in the world,” Clinton said of his public apology."
251,761575506,Melvin followed up by asking Clinton if he had ever apologized privately.
252,761575506,“I have never talked to her.
253,761575506,But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.
254,761575506,That’s very different.
255,761575506,"The apology was public,” he said."

260,761575506,"Clinton told Melvin that at the time the affair became public, “I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it.” He said later in the interview: “I dealt with it 20 years ago plus … I’ve tried to do a good job since then with my life and my work.”"
261,761575506,"Clinton also said that he did not regret his decision to fight impeachment, and noted that he left the White House $16 million in debt from his defense."

263,761575506,"In an apparent response to the “Today” interview, Lewinsky tweeted Monday that she is “grateful to the myriad people who have helped me evolve + gain perspective in the past 20 years.”"
264,761575506,"She also tweeted a link to a personal essay she wrote in February for Vanity Fair on the 20th anniversary of the investigation into the affair, in which she admitted that she suffers from PTSD over the fallout from the investigation and publicity, and that the #MeToo movement had changed her perspective on the affair and its aftermath."

382,788273361,He went on to win the Democratic primary election for Minnesota attorney general.
383,788273361,Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.
384,788273361,"Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during at a high school party nearly four decades ago, prompting prominent Democrats to get behind Ford’s allegations."

390,788273361,"As I said before, I knew I wouldn’t be believed.” Her comment came after another user pointed to comments made by Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who wrote in a tweet that the Kavanaugh accuser will be “attacked, smeared, and demonized” and that people must “believe women.” Many other Democrats and progressives – who stayed silent when the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh."
391,788273361,Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.

402,772836731,"Leaders of the Democratic Party, such as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, my former co-author in the New York Times, have responded in a non-Democratic way to the first step President Trump has taken to reduce the extremely dangerous tensions with Russia that the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes created between the two superpowers."
403,772836731,"Yes, Russia is a superpower."
404,772836731,Russian weapons are so superior to the junk produced by the waste-filled US military/security complex that lives high off the hog on the insouciant American taxpayer that it is questionable if the US is even a second class military power.
405,772836731,"If the insane neoconservatives, such as Max Boot, William Kristol, and the rest of the neocon scum get their way, the US, the UK, and Europe will be a radioactive ruin for thousands of years."
406,772836731,"House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (CA), Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, declared that out of fear of some undefined retribution from Putin, a dossier on Trump perhaps, the President of the United States sold out the American people to Russia because he wants to make peace: “It begs the question, what does Vladimir Putin, what do the Russians have on Donald Trump—personally, politically and financially that he should behave in such a manner?” The “such a manner” Pelosi is speaking about is making peace instead of war."

408,772836731,"To be clear, the Democratic Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives has accused Donald Trump of high treason against the United States."
409,772836731,"There is no outcry against this blatantly false accusation, totally devoid of evidence."
410,772836731,"The presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self-evident truth."
411,772836731,Trump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.
412,772836731,"Here is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi’s false accusation: “Millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.” If you don’t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief."
413,772836731,"Here is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: “Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors."
414,772836731,It was nothing short of treasonous.
415,772836731,"Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin."
416,772836731,Republican Patriots: Where are you??
417,772836731,?”
418,772836731,Here are many more.
419,772836731,And here is more from the CIA bought-and-paid-for BBC.
420,772836731,NOTICE THAT NOT ONE WESTERN MEDIA SOURCE IS CELEBRATING AND THANKING TRUMP AND PUTIN FOR EASING THE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED TENSIONS THAT WERE LEADING TO NUCLEAR WAR.
421,772836731,HOW CAN THIS BE?
422,772836731,HOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE?
423,772836731,WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION?
424,772836731,"The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans, as well as the rest of the world, desperately need to notice the extremely hostile reaction to peace on the part of the US Democratic Party, many members of the Republican Party, including the despicable US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the Western Presstitute Media, a collection of people on the CIA payroll according to the German newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte, and the CIA itself."
425,772836731,"Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and the rest of the corrupt filth that rules over us are all in the pay of the military/security complex."
426,772836731,Just go and investigate the donations to their re-election campaigns.
427,772836731,"The 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA’s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect."
428,772836731,"Do you know how large 1,000 billion is?"
429,772836731,You would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure.
430,772836731,"It is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting."
431,772836731,"Therefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict."
432,772836731,"The military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy."
433,772836731,"In obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy."
434,772836731,"If Trump and Putin do not understand this, they will easily be made irrelevant."
435,772836731,"They both can be assassinated, and that is what the statements from Pelosi, Schumer, McCain, Lindsey Graham, et."
436,772836731,"al., repeated endlessly in the propaganda ministry that is the Western press, encourages."
437,772836731,"Trump can be assassinated or overthrown in a political coup for selling out America to Russia, as members of both political parties claim and as the media trumpets endlessly."
438,772836731,"Putin can be easily assassinated by the CIA operatives that the Russian government stupidly permits to operate throughout Russia in NGOs and Western/US owned media and among the Atlanticist Integrationists, Washington’s Firth Column inside Russia serving Washington’s purposes."
439,772836731,These Russian traitors serve in Putin’s own government!

441,772836731,Americans are so unaware that they have no idea of the risk that President Trump is taking by challenging the US military security complex.
442,772836731,"For example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff."
443,772836731,"I was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget’s ability to meet its obligations."
444,772836731,"Republican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure."
445,772836731,"The Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984)."
446,772836731,"The Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit."
447,772836731,The Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.
448,772836731,This was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups’ handouts in order “to cut tax rates for the rich.”
449,772836731,"The supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa’s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time."
450,772836731,"When the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48-year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder."
451,772836731,"He said: “son, never set your senator up against the military/security complex."
452,772836731,"He will not be re-elected, and you will be out of a job.” I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation."
453,772836731,"He replied: “son, the military/security complex doesn’t care.”"
454,772836731,My emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond’s pat on my shoulder.
455,772836731,It grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.
456,772836731,In the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president’s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.
457,772836731,"Later as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War."
458,772836731,"Today, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us."
459,772836731,"Trump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government."
460,772836731,"The rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as “anti-American.”"
461,772836731,"If Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column—the Atlanticist Integrationists—the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane."
462,772836731,Their delusions are setting themselves up for destruction.
463,772836731,"There is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted."
464,772836731,Any government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.
465,772836731,"The entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein."
466,772836731,The purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons.
467,772836731,One is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia.
468,772836731,The other is to remove Trump’s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party.

470,772836731,President Trump is almost powerless.
471,772836731,"Putin, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans should recognize this before it is too late for them."
472,772836731,President Trump cannot fire and arrest for high treason Mueller and Rosenstein.
473,772836731,"And Trump cannot indict Hillary for her numerous unquestionable crimes in plain view of everyone, or Comey or Brennan, who declares Trump “to be wholly in the pocket of Putin,” for trying to overthrow the elected president of the United States."
474,772836731,Trump cannot have the Secret Service question the likes of Pelosi and Schumer and McCain and Lindsey Graham for false accusations that encourage assassination of the President of the United States.
475,772836731,"Trump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy."
476,772836731,"If Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history."
477,772836731,"As I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia."
478,772836731,"Leading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA’s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will."
479,772836731,"Here is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth."
480,772836731,Here is what the clued-in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.
481,772836731,"If Putin doesn’t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history."
482,772836731,Keep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.
483,772836731,"If my website goes down, you will be left in darkness."
484,772836731,No valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes.
485,772836731,"If you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope."
486,772836731,Not even I can rescue you.
487,772836731,Nor God himself.
488,772836731,"Americans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty."
489,772836731,"I doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti-Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power."
490,772836731,"The police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them."
491,772836731,"The rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America."
492,772836731,"In the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead—freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus."
493,772836731,Today there are no countries less free than the United States of America.
494,772836731,Why do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?
495,772836731,Are they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?
496,772836731,"If Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia."
497,772836731,There is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.
498,772836731,"Apparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism."
499,772836731,"The Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington’s hegemony is negotiable."

502,788847916,"Dallas, TX — As citizens call for justice in the case of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger — the cop who killed the innocent Botham Jean in his own home — the controversy continues to grow."
503,788847916,"In a town hall meeting this week, citizens showed that they still have a lot of questions for the Dallas Police Department in regards to the cold-blooded killing of Botham Jean."
504,788847916,On top of questions as to why it took several days to arrest the cop — despite the fact that Guyger admitted to it — were questions like why this person who has proven to be a threat to society has yet to be fired from the police force.
505,788847916,"During the meeting, as Chief Renee Hall dodged several questions over the details of the arrest, she did go out of her way to answer the question of why Guyger is still collecting a paycheck from their department."
506,788847916,"The short of it, according to Hall, is she can’t fire her."

517,788847916,"“I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action."
518,788847916,"There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall."
519,788847916,But experts say this is not true.
520,788847916,"As WFAA reports, Justin Moore, a civil rights attorney was a panelist at the meeting and was surprised by the Chief’s comments."
521,788847916,"“I was completely mystified, and I really didn’t understand where it came from last night."
522,788847916,"It seemed like Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law,” said Moore."
523,788847916,"WFAA went further and noted that the “the Dallas Police Department general orders do allow the chief to take action, saying, ‘The Chief of Police may circumvent all formal disciplinary procedures to render an immediate decision when it deems it necessary to preserve the integrity of the department.’”"
524,788847916,"Apparently, this “integrity” is not worth preserving and the Dallas police are going out of their way to keep a killer cop on their payroll."
525,788847916,"As WFAA pointed out, lots of cops across the state who have been under criminal investigation have been fired by police chiefs."
526,788847916,This includes cops within the Dallas police department.
527,788847916,"Amy Wilburn, a former Dallas cop shot an unarmed teen in the stomach as he sat down with his hands in the air in 2013."
528,788847916,"Days later, after her account was found to be entirely false, she was fired for it."
529,788847916,Wilburn became the first cop in 41 years — since officer Darrell Cain murdered a 12-year-old boy in the back of his squad car — to be indicted for shooting a suspect.
530,788847916,"Also in 2013, officer Cardan Spencer shot a mentally ill man in his driveway."
531,788847916,"Days later, he was also fired after surveillance video proved he was lying about what happened."
532,788847916,"So why hasn’t the chief fired Gugyer, who has actually been charged, arrested, and admitted to killing an innocent man?"
533,788847916,"Like all those accused of a crime, Amber Guyger deserves her day in court."
534,788847916,"However, as far as her job with the department is concerned, she has already proven that she is no longer fit for duty, ever again."
535,788847916,"WFAA asked the Dallas Police Department for the laws she cited claiming that she can’t fire Guyger, but they did not provide them."
536,788847916,"The department did respond about the general order mentioned by WFAA, however, saying, “General order 508 refers to the Police Chief’s ability to circumvent the formal disciplinary procedures not the investigative process.”"
537,788847916,Exactly what “investigative process” needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear as this public servant admitted to killing an innocent man in his own home.
538,788847916,"At the very least, she should be fired for this."
539,788847916,"But then again, as we’ve reported already this week, Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules than common citizens, which apparently includes keeping a paycheck after admitting to killing an unarmed, innocent, pillar of society, Botham Jean."

558,785331076,Preliminary information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift.
559,785331076,The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.

567,785331076,"If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail—right now."
568,785331076,"However, instead of immediately arresting the officer for trespassing and murder, she was simply placed on administrative leave—a glaring function of blue privilege indeed."

581,773650987,To justify such an enormous budget a major enemy is required.

591,773650987,We are currently experiencing sedition at the highest levels as the military/security complex unfolds its coup against the elected president of the United States.
592,773650987,In 1961 President Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans in his last public address that the military/industrial complex was a threat to American democracy.
593,773650987,Truer words were never spoken by an American president.
594,773650987,"Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev."
595,773650987,"To get rid of President Nixon, who made too many arms control agreements with the Soviets and opened to China, the military/security complex used its asset, the Washington Post, to orchestrate the “Watergate crisis” that the military/security complex used to force Nixon’s resignation."

612,781672902,Russiagate is an orchestration.
613,781672902,It is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia.
614,781672902,"Trump recognized that the extreme Russiaphobia, which the hegemonic neoconservatives had whipped up since Vladimir Putin’s statement at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Russia was a sovereign country and intended to act like one, was a threat to life on earth."
615,781672902,"The neoconservatives, who have controlled US foreign policy since the Clinton regime, are unwilling to accept limitations by any other country on Washington’s ability to act unilaterally."
616,781672902,"When Putin blocked the Obama regime’s invasion of Syria and bombing of Iran, the neoconservatives paid Putin back by using NGOs and Ukranian politicians financed by Washington to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine and to put in office a government hostile to Russia."
617,781672902,"The intent was to use Ukraine, a Russian province for more than three centuries, to create problems for Russia that would absorb Russia’s attention and return a free hand to Washington and Israel in the Middle East and also to evict Russia from its Black Sea naval base in Crimea."
618,781672902,"When Crimeans voted to reunite with Russia, Washington misrepresented the democratic result of self-determination as a “Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea.” Such an extraordinary misrepresentation destroyed any remaining confidence the Russian government might have had in Washington’s veracity."

620,781672902,"As I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments."
621,781672902,Donald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia.
622,781672902,The problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently.
623,781672902,After 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force.
624,781672902,President Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail.
625,781672902,"From the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the “Russian threat” that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys."
626,781672902,"Only 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion."
627,781672902,The military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military.
628,781672902,"Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump."
629,781672902,"Comey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election."
630,781672902,"Based on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump."
631,781672902,After two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people.
632,781672902,"Indeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen."
633,781672902,"He pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort."
634,781672902,Mueller’s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line.
635,781672902,"Manafort’s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller’s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate."
636,781672902,"Manafort’s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as “A dark day for Trump,” with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office."
637,781672902,"Manafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application."
638,781672902,We do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller’s frameup and an incompetent jury.
639,781672902,"American juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain."
640,781672902,Even the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury.
641,781672902,"Remember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI’s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI."
642,781672902,It is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages.

646,781672902,"So, why did Mueller focus on Manafort?"
647,781672902,Let Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:
648,781672902,"“All the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject."
649,781672902,"“The witness may not only be “singing,” he may also be “composing” — that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal."
650,781672902,"“Under federal law, the testimony of such a “flipped witness” need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction."
651,781672902,“Even one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.”
652,781672902,"President Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury."
653,781672902,"Knowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump."
654,781672902,"This tactic is used every day by state, local, and federal prosecutors."
655,781672902,Americans who believe the indictments and convictions are unaware that 97% of the time the convictions rest on self-incrimination in order to avoid worse punishment.
656,781672902,"In Manafort’s case it didn’t, or hasn’t, worked."
657,781672902,Yet.
658,781672902,"Manafort is due for a second trial, this time for allegely acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and for making false statements not under oath to the US government."
659,781672902,"Reportedly, Manafort is being held in solitary confinement, a form of torture designed to break a person’s spirit."
660,781672902,"Like Manafort’s first trial, his second trial has nothing whatsoever to do with Russiagate, but you will never learn that from the presstitute media or from the Democratic Party."
661,781672902,Manafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.
662,781672902,"What about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump?"
663,781672902,Mueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute.
664,781672902,"Therefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation."
665,781672902,"Cohen avoided a jury and said he was guilty of five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in order to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions."
666,781672902,"With regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements."
667,781672902,"He said that on Trump’s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump."
668,781672902,The intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear.
669,781672902,"Apparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money."
670,781672902,"Why a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi-billionaire doesn’t make much sense."
671,781672902,But these are not the kind of questions that the presstitutes are interested in.
672,781672902,"Nevertheless, Cohen’s plea is associated with a case brought by another prosecutor, not by Special Prosecutor Mueller."
673,781672902,I am not sufficiently familiar with US legal procedures to be able to say how this gets brought back into Mueller’s investigation.
674,781672902,The facts are this:
675,781672902,The US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia.
676,781672902,Period.
677,781672902,"At some point Putin and Lavrov and the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will have to acknowledge this fact, or Russia will be destroyed."
678,781672902,"Trump, by declaring normalization of relations as one of his two principal goals for his presidency, earned the emnity of the powerful military/security complex."
679,781672902,"By defeating Hillary for the presidency, Trump inflamed the US media’s hatred, committed as the presstitutes are to Identity Politics and hatred of the “white male oppressors” who elected Trump."
680,781672902,"Trump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who “grabs women by the pussy.”"
681,781672902,"The hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media."

686,781672902,How can a person so unclued survive?
687,781672902,"As I wrote during the presidential campaign, Trump has no idea of Washington and no idea who to appoint who would support him rather than work against him."
688,781672902,"Consequently, he has a government working against him."
689,781672902,Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are working to prevent the Republican Party from supporting the party’s president.
690,781672902,They could easily succeed.

692,781672902,What can President Trump do?
693,781672902,"He could fight, not with words on Twitter, but with the powers of the presidency."
694,781672902,There is far more evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States than there is evidence that it is a Trump-Putin conspiracy to steal the election from Hillary.
695,781672902,"If Mueller can indict on the basis of no evidence, Trump can order the Attorney General to indict on the basis of massive evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States."

701,781672902,Trump is wrong on the environment.
702,781672902,Environmental protections put in place after years of struggle are being eviscerated by industry polluters who have gained controll over the environmental regulatory agencies.
703,781672902,This is not a unique happening of the Trump presidency.
704,781672902,"It began under VP Dick Cheney, the real president during the 8 years of the George W. Bush regime."
705,781672902,Cheney turned the environmental protection regulatory agencies over to industry polluters.
706,781672902,Trump is wrong on Iran.
707,781672902,"He is in Israel’s hands, hoping that the power of the Israel Lobby can shield him from the presstitutes and the military/security complex."
708,781672902,What Israel is doing by attempting to use US military force against Iran is unifying a new alliance that is too powerful for the Washington/Israeli alliance.
709,781672902,"Russia, China, Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, and Pakistan are the locations of populations that massively outnumber Washington’s empire."
710,781672902,Each of these countries are being united by Washington’s stupid and inexplicable actions against each.
711,781672902,"Militarily, Israel is of no consequence."
712,781672902,"Twice the vaunted Israeli Army, capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children, were defeated and driven out of southern Lebanon by a few thousand Hezbollah militia."

714,781672902,"The entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see?"
715,781672902,"Two countries, both the result of exterminating the native populations, distrusted and universally hated, both of which survive by purhasing the governments of other countries and by endless lies that describe everyone but themselves and their vassals as evil criminals that must be destroyed."
716,781672902,"For example, the Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world, is being systematically destroyed along with all life within it by Israel under cover of the obvious and transparanent lie that all within Gaza are terrorists outfitted with bomb belts who are committed to the destruction of Israel."

720,781672902,"For China, money is now all."
721,781672902,The Russians are infected with the American propaganda infused into their veins during the Yeltsin era when Russia was an American puppet state.
722,781672902,"Slowly, if not surely, the Russians are coming to their senses and realizing that they have no American “partner.”"
723,781672902,"If Trump is defeated and moved off the table, what happens when Russia and China finally realize that there is to be no conciliation with Washington?"
724,781672902,"When all the false hopes and bets of the Russian and Chinese governments of conciliation on the basis of mutual economic interests come to naught, what happens?"
725,781672902,It will be the end of life on earth.
726,781672902,The Russiagate “investigation” appears to be timed to influence the midterm elections with unsubstantiated accusations made just before the elections in an attempt to produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach President Trump on false charges.
727,781672902,The presstitutes would cover up the frameup.
728,781672902,"In other words, the real election meddling is being done by the Russiagate “investigation.” See here and here."
729,781672902,Such an impeachment would be a coup.

781,832908905,"Barr, in his letter to congressional leaders, said Mueller’s investigation was conducted properly."
782,832908905,The attorney general said he was required to inform congressional leaders if Mueller had done anything “inappropriate or unwarranted.”

789,832908905,Trump: ‘Let people see it’
790,832908905,House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer released a joint statement insisting Barr release the full report to the public and not give the White House a “sneak preview.”
791,832908905,"“Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,” they said."
792,832908905,"“Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any ‘sneak preview’ of Special Counsel Mueller’s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public."
793,832908905,"The Democratic leaders said Mueller’s investigation “focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.”"
794,832908905,“The American people have a right to the truth.
795,832908905,"The watchword is transparency,” they said."

797,832908905,“Let it come out.

806,832908905,“The Mueller report delivery suggests no more indictments are coming from the Special Counsel.
807,832908905,"If that’s true, it would mean we just completed 2 years of investigating ‘Russian collusion’ without ONE collusion related indictment."
808,832908905,"Not even one,” he wrote on Twitter."
809,832908905,“Why?
810,832908905,Because there was no collusion.”
811,832908978,Trump Kept Asking Friends If the Mueller Report Would Drop This Week
812,832908978,"On Wednesday, Donald Trump was flying to a military tank plant in Lima, Ohio, to deliver a speech on the economy, but, as is frequently the case, the president had something more pressing on his mind."
813,832908978,"While aboard Air Force One, the president killed some time by picking up the phone and ringing associates to ask them if they thought Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would be sent to the Department of Justice this week, according to a source with knowledge of these conversations."
814,832908978,"The report, which would mark the culmination of Mueller and his team’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice, has for many months kicked off round after round of speculation among the media and political class about when, exactly, it will finally be delivered to the Justice Department."
815,832908978,"This week, the President of the United States himself joined in on the anxious anticipation and the Mueller report guessing game."
816,832908978,"According to three knowledgeable sources, Trump has quizzed various people—administration officials, friends, his legal team—throughout the week if they believed the buzz that the Mueller report could be delivered as soon as this week."
817,832908978,"The president, these sources said, speculated on when he thought it would finally happen, repeatedly citing news reports from this week on a possible imminent delivery."
818,832908978,"Reached for comment, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied that there was “nothing to add right now,” as of Friday afternoon."
819,832908978,"“I told the president this morning [to] go about your schedule, we’re prepared for anything,” Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, told The Daily Beast on Friday, adding that he spoke with the president in person on Thursday."
820,832908978,"Giuliani said that he and the president have been hearing the report delivery could happen “today,” but clarified that he and his client are going off of media, not any “insider information.”"
821,832908978,"Trump’s reelection campaign also got in on this week’s speculation game, texting supporters early Friday afternoon, “President Trump has put up with the WITCH HUNT for 2 YEARS."
822,832908978,Do you think it's time for it to end?
823,832908978,Take our OFFICIAL poll NOW.”
824,832908978,"The president, who has repeatedly claimed that the Mueller investigation is “illegal” and a “WITCH HUNT” driven by angry liberals, made clear to reporters at the White House earlier this week that the coming report was, of course, weighing on him."
825,832908978,"“Let it come out, let people see it,” Trump said, characterizing the probe and report as “ridiculous,” as he left the White House on Wednesday."
826,832908978,“Let’s see whether or not it’s legit.”
827,832908978,"But over the course of the last two years, he hasn’t always been so open to the report seeing the light of day, or even having the investigation conclude."
828,832908978,"As The New York Times reported early last year, Trump ordered the firing of the special counsel, but reversed course after the then-White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would resign instead of executing Trump’s order."
829,832908978,"Still, even after the Mueller probe officially wraps, it is very much the beginning, not a dramatic end, to Trumpworld’s wide-ranging legal woes."
830,832908978,"On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Democratic chairs of six different House committees investigating Trump and his allies are planning on asking the FBI, Department of Justice, and White House to preserve records provided to Mueller and his investigators."
831,832908978,President Trump himself appears to realize that the end is nowhere near.
832,832908978,"As The Daily Beast reported last month, the president made clear to his outside legal team, which includes Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, that he wanted his attorneys sitting tight, even after the Mueller investigation is history."
833,832908978,"Trump broached the topic in multiple conversations beginning late last year, while discussing the other inquiries threatening his presidency and inner circle, chief among them the Southern District of New York."
834,832908978,"But if the Mueller report is actually, finally sent over to the Justice Department by close of business on Friday, the president will be many miles away from it."
835,832908978,"On Friday morning, Trump flew to Palm Beach, Florida, where he and first lady Melania Trump were scheduled to meet with Caribbean leaders at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private club and getaway."
836,763280007,Geert Wilders Puts the Political Elites On Notice
837,763280007,Geert Wilders spoke at a massive rally for Tommy Robinson on Saturday.
838,763280007,"20,000 people came out to call for Tommy’s release, and Wilders took the opportunity to put the political elites of Britain and continental Europe on notice."
839,763280007,"“Our governments,” Wilders declared, “sold us out with mass immigration."
840,763280007,With Islamization.
841,763280007,With open borders.
842,763280007,We are almost foreigners in our own lands.
843,763280007,"And if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes."
844,763280007,"But I say, no more!"
845,763280007,And what do you say?
846,763280007,No more!
847,763280007,And that’s right: enough is enough.
848,763280007,We will not be gagged anymore.
849,763280007,No more tyranny.”
850,763280007,It was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all.
851,763280007,"Several years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever – at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration."
852,763280007,"Even worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern."
853,763280007,"Pamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad."
854,763280007,"Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation."
855,763280007,"Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain."
856,763280007,"The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things."
857,763280007,"One – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest."
858,763280007,Second – burn them to death.
859,763280007,Third – throw ’em off a cliff.
860,763280007,Fourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.
861,763280007,Fifth – a combination of the above.”
862,763280007,Theresa May’s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.
863,763280007,One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
864,763280007,"Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country."
865,763280007,But now matters are coming to a head.
866,763280007,Apparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again.
867,763280007,"And so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny."
868,763280007,Tommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs.
869,763280007,"Clearly the government’s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators."
870,763280007,"Theresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of “diversity” and “multiculturalism” will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence."
871,763280007,"The British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable."
872,763280007,"That heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now."
873,763280007,"British public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state."
874,763280007,"Wilders addressed this endeavor head-on, declaring: “We will not be silenced."
875,763280007,We will not be intimidated.
876,763280007,"And we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you."
877,763280007,We will never surrender.
878,763280007,We will stand strong and do our duty.
879,763280007,We will defend our civilization.
880,763280007,And we will protect our people.”
881,763280007,"Wilders added: “And I tell you, to the governments."
882,763280007,"You can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us."
883,763280007,"Because, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up."
884,763280007,"So take notice, Theresa May."
885,763280007,"Take notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte."
886,763280007,"Take notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron."
887,763280007,Take notice: the future is ours and not yours.
888,763280007,"We will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.”"
889,763280007,"If Wilders’ words don’t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand."

892,832916492,A panel on CNN’s Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer reacted live on air to news that the Mueller report has concluded and resulted in no new indictments by admitting that President Trump has won a “huge victory.”
893,832916492,"“He’s been vindicated by them,” Evan Pérez said of President Trump and the Mueller report."
894,832916492,"“And then he’s now vindicated, exactly,” Gloria Borger said."
895,832916492,“You know–how do you manage that politically?
896,832916492,"I mean, we obviously can’t jump the gun here."
897,832916492,"We have to see what comes out from Barr, and what’s in the report."
898,832916492,"But if I’m at Mar-A-Lago with the president, as Pamela has been reporting, the lawyers are … that I would be very happy,” she added."
899,832916492,"Later, a panel member concluded that the Mueller report was in fact a “huge victory” for President Trump."
900,832916492,"“A couple of victories here,” CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz said."
901,832916492,“The president did not have to sit down for an interview.
902,832916492,"They were so concerned about that, because he’d get caught up in lies–and there’d be perjury traps."
903,832916492,"Okay, so that’s now over."
904,832916492,No more people being indicted.
905,832916492,"Sealed, unsealed–no more indictments."
906,832916492,Mueller is done.
907,832916492,"Huge victory for the president,” he said."
908,832916492,Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded the Russia investigation and turned over his report to Attorney General Willian Barr Friday afternoon.
909,832916492,"According to multiple reports, there will be no further indictments in the report, sealed or unsealed."
910,832916492,"Important: No more sealed or unsealed indictments coming from Robert Mueller a DOJ officials tells @LauraAJarrett — Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) March 22, 2019"
911,832916492,WASHINGTON (AP) — AP Source: Special counsel Robert Mueller is not recommending any further indictments in the Russia probe.
912,832916492,"— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 22, 2019"
913,832916492,"According to ABC News, President Trump is reportedly “glad it’s over.”"
914,832908730,Mueller Submits His Russia Report to Justice Department
915,832908730,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his 22-month Russia investigation and submitted a report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, triggering a clamor from Congress to see the findings."
916,832908730,A Justice Department official told the Associated Press that Mueller is not recommending any further indictments.
917,832908730,"In a letter to the heads of the Senate and House judiciary committees, Barr described Mueller’s submission as a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions he has reached.”"
918,832908730,"“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the letter said."
919,832908730,"Barr did not detail what the report contains, but did say that the Justice Department did not overrule any decision Mueller made."
920,832908730,"Barr said he will consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has mostly overseen the Special Counsel’s Office, about “what other information from the report” can be released to Congress and the public."
921,832908730,The White House and President Trump’s lawyers said the next decisions are up to Barr.
922,832908730,There is a possibility that Barr releases two separate reports.
923,832908730,One would summarize Mueller’s findings without including classified information and would be given to Congress—and would then most likely find its way out into the public.
924,832908730,"The other would be given to a smaller group of lawmakers who head major congressional committees, such as the House and Senate intelligence committees."
925,832908730,"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of House Intelligence, called for transparency."
926,832908730,“Mueller’s investigation began as a counterintelligence inquiry into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were compromised by a foreign power.
927,832908730,"By law, that evidence he uncovered must be shared with our Committee,” he said in a tweet."
928,832908730,“And his report must also be made public.
929,832908730,Now.”
930,832908730,Trump has previously said he supports the idea of making the report public.
931,832908730,"“I don’t mind,” he has said."
932,832908730,"“I mean, frankly, I told the House, ‘If you want, let them see it.’”"
933,832908730,Trump has also vigorously denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly branded the probe as a “total witch hunt.”
934,832908730,"Mueller will remain as special counsel for a period of time as he and a small contingent of staff close the office, a Justice Department spokesperson reportedly said."
935,832908730,"The handover of the report marks the end of an investigation that has for nearly two years transfixed the nation, yielded dozens of indictments and convictions, and brought down a handful of Trump’s closest advisers."
936,832908730,"The Special Counsel’s Office was tasked broadly with investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matters that arose directly from the probe."
937,832908730,"However, the scope of the investigation seems to have bled outside those lines."
938,832908730,"Several witnesses, for example, have been questioned about other countries’ efforts to meddle in American politics, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE and Qatar."
939,832908730,"So far, the Special Counsel’s Office has indicted or obtained guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies."
940,832908730,"Six of those are former Trump associates, and 25 of them are Russians."
941,832908730,No Americans have been charged with conspiring with Russians to meddle in the 2016 elections—at least none the public knows about.
942,832908730,"But major Trumpworld figures were charged with a variety of other crimes, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, deputy campaign chairman Richard Gates and Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen."
943,832908730,"Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for crimes he committed while working for Trump, including the payments he made to two adult film star actresses for their alleged affairs with his boss."
944,832908730,Manafort was sentenced in both Virginia and in Washington and will serve about seven years in prison.
945,832908730,"In Washington, Manafort was sentenced for for conspiring against the U.S. and a conspiracy to obstruct justice connected to his covert lobbying on behalf of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government."
946,832908730,He was sentenced in Virginia for bank and wire fraud.
947,832908730,"The Special Counsel’s Office said in a court filing last week that it had gotten all it can out of Flynn, who has been cooperating for months after pleading guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak."
948,832908730,It’s unclear when he will be sentenced but his lawyers want to wait until the trial for his former business partners begins in Virginia.
949,832908730,"Gates has also been cooperating on a wide variety of topics associated with the Russia investigation, including the work of Manafort."
950,832908730,"As of March, Gates was still offering the Mueller team information about his time working for Trump."
951,832908730,He pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.
952,832908730,Several other law enforcement agencies have picked up pieces of Mueller’s Russia investigation.
953,832908730,The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is actively probing the Trump inaugural committee to determine if it received illegal foreign donations and if any of that money flowed through American intermediaries.
954,832908730,The Eastern District of New York has reportedly taken over some aspects of that probe.
955,832908730,SDNY is also looking into the hush money payments Trump made to two former adult film actresses via Cohen.
956,832908730,A host of other local and state law enforcement offices are working on matters related to the Trump campaign and Trump organization.
957,832908730,"Congress has also launched several of its own probes into White House security clearances, Trump’s tax returns and possible obstruction of justice."
958,761568202,Bill Clinton: ‘I Did The Right Thing’ During Lewinsky Affair; ‘I Do Not’ Owe Her Apology
959,761568202,Former president Bill Clinton has spoken out about what happened during his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
960,761568202,"Among other things, Clinton says Lewinsky is not owed an apology from him and he “did the right thing.”"
961,761568202,"As reported by CNN, Speaking to Today, Clinton defended his decision to remain in office following the scandal."
962,761568202,"“A lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work, I think partly because they’re frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don’t seem to care,” Clinton said, pointing to a series of sexual misconduct allegations against current President Donald Trump, who has denied them."
963,761568202,“I think I did the right thing.
964,761568202,I defended the Constitution.”
965,761568202,"In an essay for Vanity Fair published earlier this year, Lewinsky said she was questioning the narrative surrounding the affair, which played a central role in Clinton’s eventual impeachment."
966,761568202,"“Now, at 44, I’m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,” she wrote."
967,761568202,“I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.”
968,761568202,"When asked if he owed Lewinsky an apology, President Clinton told NBC‘s Craig Melvin, “No, I do not — I have never talked to her."
969,761568202,But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.
970,761568202,That’s very different.
971,761568202,"The apology was public.” Although some may not have taken what Clinton said as an apology, he did publicly acknowledge at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1998 that he had “sinned.”"
972,761568202,“I don’t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned.
973,761568202,"It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine — first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people.”"

975,776126299,"In July, I reported that the Department of Justice finally settled with Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over his 3D-print gun plans being lawful."
976,776126299,The DOJ surrendered in the matter and accepted the fact that the plans are protected under the First Amendment.
977,776126299,"However, a federal judge, in a lawsuit brought by eight states and the District of Columbia, has blocked the plans from being released."
978,776126299,"The judge should understand that these plans are protected under the First Amendment in the same way that any other printed material is, and that there is no crime that has been committed by making them available to people online."
979,776126299,"Second, if that were not enough, we already know that the Second Amendment protects actual arms from restriction and the right to keep and bear them from infringement."

991,776126299,Fox News has the story:
992,776126299,"U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms."
993,776126299,"The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday."
994,776126299,The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.
995,776126299,"In the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans."
996,776126299,"Trump said Tuesday that he's ""looking into"" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public ""doesn't seem to make much sense!"""
997,776126299,Doesn't make much sense?
998,776126299,Are you people serious?
999,776126299,"Why, yes, yes they are serious."
1000,776126299,Deadly serious.
1001,776126299,"It makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public."
1002,776126299,"The eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are."
1003,776126299,Washington
1004,776126299,Connecticut
1005,776126299,Maryland
1006,776126299,New Jersey
1007,776126299,New York
1008,776126299,Oregon
1009,776126299,Massachusetts
1010,776126299,Pennsylvania
1011,776126299,Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:
1012,776126299,"...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns."
1013,776126299,"In fact, the agreement states that it ""does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation."""
1014,776126299,The lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.
1015,776126299,Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.
1016,776126299,That system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.
1017,776126299,Note that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:
1018,776126299,"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
1019,776126299,(emphasis mine)
1020,776126299,"Since our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the ""right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,"" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms."
1021,776126299,"he is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one."
1022,776126299,Reason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:
1023,776126299,"Josh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that ""The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement."
1024,776126299,"This latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration."""
1025,776126299,"As reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them."
1026,776126299,(Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.)
1027,776126299,"While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files—which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do—the distribution is already happening."
1028,776126299,Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter.
1029,776126299,"He told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun-making files, that ""This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed—because you all are trying to stop me."
1030,776126299,"That seemed natural and ended up being true."""
1031,776126299,"So far, that has continued to be true."
1032,776126299,This federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs.
1033,776126299,"Instead, he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in."
1034,776126299,"Speaking of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson, enter to win this Ghost Gunner 2 and make your own guns at home!"
1035,999001323,Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta’s press credential
1036,999001323,CNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.
1037,999001323,U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta’s White House press credential.
1038,999001323,Kelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.
1039,999001323,He did not rule on CNN’s claim that the revocation of the journalist’s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.
1040,999001323,But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.
1041,999001323,"The ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access."
1042,999001323,CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House’s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.
1043,999001323,"“We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,” a CNN representative said in a statement."
1044,999001323,"“Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.”"
1045,999001323,The White House said it would abide by Kelly’s ruling.
1046,999001323,"“Today, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House."
1047,999001323,"In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement."
1048,999001323,“We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.
1049,999001323,There must be decorum in the White House.”
1050,999001323,Acosta’s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference.
1051,999001323,"At one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him."
1052,999001323,"It was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN’s critical coverage of him as “fake news” since the 2016 presidential campaign."
1053,999001323,CNN’s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta’s credential violates the First Amendment’s protection of free speech.
1054,999001323,"It also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment’s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act."
1055,999001323,"“This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting — an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president’s point of view,” the suit says."
1056,999001323,"Responding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public."
1057,999001323,"“If the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing."
1058,999001323,“There’s no First Amendment right.”
1059,999001323,"The White House argued that Acosta’s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential."
1060,999001323,"Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge’s decision, which he said was not a surprise."
1061,999001323,"“The White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that’s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it’s important that the court stood up and said that,” Lukasiewicz said."
1062,999001323,“It’s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn’t like.”
1063,999001323,Lukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.
1064,999001323,"“The law and the Constitution is very clear here,” he said."
1065,999001323,"CNN’s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump’s criticisms of the network’s coverage."
1066,999001323,Rival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.
1067,999001323,"Fox News commentators were President Barack Obama’s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private."
1068,999001323,But the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked.
1069,999001323,"Fox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN."

1074,740235127,"Rand Paul: I'll Do ""Whatever It Takes"" To Block Haspel & Pompeo"
1075,740235127,Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has expressed some of my thoughts when it comes to the newly nominated Secretary of State and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
1076,740235127,"Paul told CNN’s “State of the Union” and CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he would do ""whatever it takes,"" including a filibuster, to block the confirmations of Mike Pompeo to head the State Department and Gina Haspel to run the CIA."
1077,740235127,"“You really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war,” he told “Face the Nation.”"
1078,740235127,"“I frankly think that Pompeo’s positions are too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere,” he added."
1079,740235127,"""I don't think our policy ought to be for regime change, so I think Pompeo really isn't a good fit to be a diplomat."""
1080,740235127,"He's right, too."
1081,740235127,Pompeo has advocated for regime change in North Korea.
1082,740235127,"We've seen exactly what happens when the US gets involved in such types of regime changes, and the truth is that they really don't work out too well."
1083,740235127,"As for Haspel, Paul told ""Face The Nation,"" ""She oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture."
1084,740235127,"I don't think torture is what America is about."""
1085,740235127,"On ""State of the Union,"" Paul added, ""I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster"" to block their confirmation."
1086,740235127,"""I don't have the power to stop her nomination,"" he said of Haspel."
1087,740235127,"""There's enough votes she'll eventually win."
1088,740235127,Few things in life .
1089,740235127,.
1090,740235127,.
1091,740235127,"[are] worth standing up saying 'enough is enough.'"""
1092,740235127,"""We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful that we think that torture is somehow acceptable,"" he added."
1093,740235127,"""On what level could torture ever be acceptable?"
1094,740235127,We should make a stand on this.
1095,740235127,"She should never lead the CIA."""
1096,740235127,"Both nominations may face tough confirmation hearings, but it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices."
1097,740235127,The only thing I can think for that kind of reasoning is that people do not know their Constitution and understand exactly what Senator Paul is trying to warn America about.
1098,740235127,"Instead, people are acting out of emotion and fear."
1099,740235127,Do I believe we should be concerned about North Korea?
1100,740235127,"Sure, but I'm hardly worried that they will actually attack us."
1101,740235127,Am I concerned about jihadis?
1102,740235127,"Yep, but I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information that has led to stopping terror attacks."
1103,740235127,"And before you tell me about the media reports and CIA involvement, just keep in mind that a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA."
1104,740235127,"So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results from the tactics used."
1105,740235127,"Trump has obviously had praise for both Pompeo and Haspel, but then again, his administration has quite a bit of turn over too."
1106,740235127,"Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State."
1107,740235127,He will do a fantastic job!
1108,740235127,Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!
1109,740235127,"Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen."
1110,740235127,Congratulations to all!
1111,740235127,"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018"
1112,740235127,We'll see how things turn out and I'm sure Senator Paul is not issuing an empty threat in the matter.
1113,738442776,Yikes!
1114,738442776,Even John McCain is worried about Trump’s CIA pick
1115,738442776,Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.
1116,738442776,"After President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to head the Central Intelligence Agency Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans need answers about her past involvement in state sponsored torture programs."
1117,738442776,"As I noted earlier today, Haspel’s long career at the CIA spanned the years of torture carried out under the George W. Bush White House."
1118,738442776,A 2013 Washington Post report on the new CIA head called her role in the torture programs of that era “extensive” and noted that at one point she ran a CIA “black site” in Thailand where torture occurred.
1119,738442776,"In a lengthy statement following Haspel’s nomination, McCain expressed big concerns about what it means for the agency’s future, saying:"
1120,738442776,"During his own confirmation proceedings for Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo repeatedly committed that he would comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual’s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA."
1121,738442776,"The American people now deserve the same assurances from Gina Haspel, whose career with the agency has intersected with the program of so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ on a number of occasions."
1122,738442776,The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history.
1123,738442776,Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process.
1124,738442776,I know the Senate will do its job in examining Ms. Haspel’s record as well as her beliefs about torture and her approach to current law.
1125,738442776,"In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, our government squandered precious moral authority in a futile effort to produce intelligence by means of torture."
1126,738442776,We are still dealing with the consequences of that desperately misguided decision.
1127,738442776,Current U.S. law is clear in banning enhanced interrogation techniques.
1128,738442776,"Any nominee for Director of the CIA must pledge without reservation to uphold this prohibition, which has helped us to regain our position of leadership in the struggle for universal human rights—the struggle upon which this country was founded, and which remains its highest aspiration."
1129,738442776,Americans who value the Constitution should take this rare moment to agree with McCain.
1130,832917778,Reports: No New Indictments Will Come From Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Probe
1131,832917778,"No new indictments will come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe after he submitted his final report to Attorney General William Barr, multiple outlets are reporting."
1132,832917778,"A senior Justice Department official told The Washington Post that Mueller “has not recommended any further indictments.” “The investigation is complete,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told the newspaper."
1133,832917778,"The Mueller probe saw several within Trump's orbit indicted, but not Trump’s family or Trump himself."
1134,832917778,"Some notable figures who have pleaded guilty in charges stemming from Mueller’s investigation are Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn."
1135,777720051,11 Children Have Been Rescued From a Muslim Extremist-Run Compound In NM
1136,777720051,Eleven children were rescued from a compound in New Mexico which was being run by armed Muslim extremists.
1137,777720051,Authorities found all the children living in deplorable living conditions after raiding the property looking specifically for a three-year-old boy.
1138,777720051,"According to The Daily Caller, the police didn’t find the little boy, named Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, but they did discover 11 other children between the ages of one and 15-years-old being held in the “saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,” Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement posted to the agency’s Facebook page Saturday."
1139,777720051,Hogrefe also added that he only saw a few potatoes and a box of rice as food at the compound.
1140,777720051,"Abdul-Ghani’s mother reported her son missing after Wahhaj took the boy, who turned 4 on Monday, to the park in Clayton County, Georgia, and didn’t return, The Albuquerque Journal reported."
1141,777720051,She added the boy suffers from a medical condition.
1142,777720051,"Investigators believe that the three-year-old boy, who turned four on Monday, they were looking for had been at the compound in earlier weeks."
1143,777720051,"Siraj Wahhaj, 39, and Lucas Morten, two very heavily armed men who are believed to be “extremist[s] of the Muslim belief,” were running the horrifying compound, Hogrefe said."
1144,777720051,"When police arrived on the scene, Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and several loaded 30-round magazines."
1145,777720051,He also allegedly had on him four loaded pistols.
1146,777720051,"According to a report by Fox News, Hogrefe said authorities had conducted surveillance of the compound while looking for the missing boy before he decided Thursday to get a search warrant."
1147,777720051,The warrant was immediately obtained after a Georgia investigator forwarded a message in which someone at the compound reportedly told another person that people who were living in the shanty were starving and needed water.
1148,777720051,"“The message sent to a third party simply said in part, ‘We are starving and need food and water,’” Hogrefe said."
1149,777720051,“I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible.”
1150,777720051,Police stated on Sunday that they are still looking for Abdul-Ghani.
1151,999001419,Trump Vows to Kick CNN’s Acosta Out Again
1152,999001419,"President Trump took CNN’s improbable court victory temporarily restoring CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s “hard pass” media credential for the executive mansion in stride, vowing to kick Acosta out again in the future if he breaches White House protocol again."
1153,999001419,"The yanking of the physical credential, by the way, isn’t exactly a grave hardship."
1154,999001419,"It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non-hard pass-holding journalists who don’t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do."
1155,999001419,Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House.
1156,999001419,"Speaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers."
1157,999001419,"""I think one of the things we’ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don’t have any air time, although I’ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,"" Trump said."
1158,999001419,"""I mean, with this stuff you never know what’s going to happen."""
1159,999001419,"The president described Acosta as ""unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who’s a wonderful woman,"" and said his administration is drawing up ""rules and regulations"" for White House reporters."
1160,999001419,"""And if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference,"" Trump said."
1161,999001419,Acosta’s hard pass was pulled after a contentious Nov. 7 press conference at the White House.
1162,999001419,After interacting with President Trump – Acosta said he wanted to “challenge” him on calling the Central American caravans an “invasion” – the president called upon another reporter to speak.
1163,999001419,"After lecturing Trump, Acosta belligerently refused to yield the microphone to a White House staffer and pushed her arm away as she reached for the device, all of which was captured on video."
1164,999001419,"On Nov. 16, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta’s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit."
1165,999001419,But it was not a vindication of Acosta’s free speech rights under the First Amendment.
1166,999001419,The judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences.
1167,999001419,"The temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution."
1168,999001419,The White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences.
1169,999001419,The U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing.
1170,999001419,"“The President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences."
1171,999001419,"We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions."""
1172,999001419,"Acosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory."
1173,999001419,"""I'm very grateful for what happened today,"" Acosta said."
1174,999001419,"""I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this."""

1178,999001419,The court case isn’t over yet.
1179,999001419,The legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon.
1180,999001419,"The court ordered the parties to “file a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]” according to its online docket."
1181,999001419,"According to CNN, “White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.”"

1192,798244842,More Independent Media To Be Shut Down
1193,798244842,"The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings."
1194,798244842,We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
1195,798244842,"Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions."
1196,798244842,"Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it."
1197,798244842,And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.

1199,798244842,"If you haven’t already heard, Facebook has completely shut down hundreds, if not thousands of Independent media pages over the last year."
1200,798244842,"Some of the biggest pages include The Free Thought Project and The Anti-media, with millions of followers each, and years of sourced journalism."
1201,798244842,"These pages, among others, became targets a long time ago."
1202,798244842,"Working directly in the field and behind the scenes, I can tell you that all of us have been aware of the censorship initiative for a long time because it started approximately three years ago now."
1203,798244842,"The complete deletion of multiple pages kicked off by popular media figure Alex Jones, was followed by a massive campaign of “fake news” awareness."
1204,798244842,"One thing we need to remember here is, this isn’t about democrats vs republicans, it’s about the elite preserving their control, and at the moment, they are using the DNC as the mouthpiece for that."
1205,798244842,"Thus, anything that slandered Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, for example, was labelled as fake news, even if evidence and credible sources were used."
1206,798244842,This is because she is part of that elite.
1207,798244842,"This is cyber false flagging at its finest, where authority figures at Facebook and within government agencies decide for the people what is real, and what is not, These tactics are complemented by a large mainstream media campaign that created awareness about fake news."

1210,798244842,"Many believed what media and social media did during that election, and still now, and take on the opinion that people cannot just say what they want on the internet."
1211,798244842,"This has some validity, but ultimately, the fact that Facebook pages with credibility were deleted makes it quite clear what’s going on here."
1212,798244842,"These pages presented declassified documents, information about corporations and mainstream media, real whistleblower testimony and more."
1213,798244842,"Yet still, they were deleted."
1214,798244842,"The population should be able to examine a source of information and determine for themselves if it’s credible, not have an authority figure do it for them."
1215,798244842,"We don’t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers!"
1216,798244842,"We have a responsibility to our planet to be those fact checkers, and not let authority figures with a tremendous amount of power, wealth, and conflicts of interests do it for us."
1217,798244842,"“The problem of fake news isn’t solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because we as citizens, we as users of these services, help each other."

1222,798244842,Facebook A Revolving Door
1223,798244842,"Facebook has become a revolving door like Monsanto, with high-ranking DARPA employees, like Regina Duggan, who has since left Facebook, and people from similar backgrounds now spearheading their mission."
1224,798244842,What is Facebook’s mission?
1225,798244842,Well at the moment it seems to be censoring of information.
1226,798244842,Their key strategy is to label everything as fake news to build an excuse to delete Facebook pages that are dissenting voices.
1227,798244842,"You see, independent media, like CE, became extremely popular, receiving many millions in website every single month, that traffic came from Facebook."
1228,798244842,Independent media outlets were greatly surpassing mainstream media in their power and voice.
1229,798244842,"This is something people on the outside can’t really see as all of this happens, but I am on the inside, so I see exactly what’s taking place."
1230,798244842,Eyes were shifting away from the small group of people who have controlled media since media’s inception.
1231,798244842,"Independent media brought to light a number of facts that threaten the agenda of the global elite, like intelligence agency/government connections to mainstream media for example, and their plans in the middle east to basically invade, take-over, and establish a government that suits the Deep State’s best interests."
1232,798244842,"There are several examples from all fields that surround human life, from healthcare to politics, and it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top."
1233,798244842,We’ve been writing about this for nearly a decade now.
1234,798244842,The Deep State Has Power Due To Our Unconsciousness
1235,798244842,They (global elite) continue to do what they are able to do because of human consciousness.
1236,798244842,"The more people who consider this a “conspiracy theory” and turn their heads away, the easier it is for them to continue and have power."
1237,798244842,"I don’t understand how so much information can come to light, yet when it’s deemed a “conspiracy” theory” within mainstream media, everybody simply follows the rhetoric, without doing any investigation or research for themselves."
1238,798244842,"If you don’t look into it, don’t share an opinion on it."
1239,798244842,“Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.” – Einstein.
1240,798244842,"All of these media sources were operating normally until Donald Trump became president, and until Hillary Clinton, Obama, Bush, etc were outed as global elite puppets."
1241,798244842,"Heck, the Clinton’s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became ‘fake.’ Despite operating with credibility for more than a decade before the accusations."
1242,798244842,What does the media operating normally mean?
1243,798244842,"Still manipulating the public, but at least they were reporting on both sides as a whole."
1244,798244842,"Now, it’s quite different."
1245,798244842,"Donald Trump is extremely vilified not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist, but because he threatens neoliberalism and neoconservatism, the American empire, one that continues to try and push an Orwellian state type of existence, which seems to be ramping up every single year."
1246,798244842,"Trump was not supposed to win, and no this isn’t about democrats vs republicans or that Trump is a saviour."
1247,798244842,"The Deep State responded like they always do every time something ‘goes wrong,’ they blamed Russia, as well as media outlets like Collective Evolution and others."
1248,798244842,Some of which have now been deleted as mentioned above.
1249,798244842,"Trump is Not The Solution, We Are"
1250,798244842,"Things are getting pretty ridiculous, but they’re too late."
1251,798244842,"Even if they do succeed in deleting more independent media sites from social media, they cannot erase them from the internet."
1252,798244842,"Yes, social media platforms were great for spreading information across the internet and for having more people become aware of it."
1253,798244842,"It really showed what people were interested in, and what people wanted to see, but clearly, we do not live in a democracy and that doesn’t matter."

1255,798244842,"People are still going to search for information, and alternative forms of information, given the fact that what they see coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect and questionable."
1256,798244842,More and more people see it this way because our consciousness continues to shift.
1257,798244842,"Social media platforms do not control the awakening but have been a great tool to grow it, but it’s something that cannot be stopped."
1258,798244842,"The more we awaken and truly see past the political games, the more we pull power from the power grid that keeps all this in place."
1259,798244842,2020
1260,798244842,"Now, all of this seems to be taking place with perfect timing before the 2020 election."
1261,798244842,"No doubt that the Deep State will want to take back the presidency, but ultimately, we need to see the bigger picture here."
1262,798244842,"We need to see what politics actually is, and the past few years alone have provided us with the opportunity to see."
1263,798244842,"It’s nothing but elite people, corporations and the financial elite that have become drenched with so much power that they have been able to direct human will and use it for their own selfish purposes."
1264,798244842,"With powerful revelations that have come to light, like elite pedophilia and ritual abuse, and extreme corruption, why do we still participate?"
1265,798244842,Why do we choose to elect these people?
1266,798244842,"Why do we believe we live in a democracy when what people want to look at, and what the majority of people want to have done (like GMO-labelling), is completely censored?"
1267,798244842,"Why are harmful ‘things’ surrounding us constantly when we have science showing it’s not safe, like cell phone towers etc."
1268,798244842,It’s simply because power lies within the corporatocracy.
1269,798244842,"Decisions aren’t being made with the best interest of humanity at heart, and this is why the system is failing because it’s not actually for the people."
1270,798244842,"Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means … We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state … It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government … This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group … is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts."
1271,798244842,It is practically irremovable.
1272,798244842,– Senator William Jenner (source)
1273,798244842,"Before 2020, they’re going to want to silence anything that creates awareness about the corruption, deceit and lies that have dominated the presidency and the entire military-industrial complex for years."
1274,798244842,The fact of the matter is:
1275,798244842,“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.
1276,798244842,Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
1277,798244842,"We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” – Edward Bernays (“the father of public relations”), Propaganda, 1928 (note that Bernays’ book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote)."
1278,798244842,"This is what’s unravelling, and the stronger the push the unravel it, the stronger the reaction and response from the deep state."
1279,798244842,The Takeaway
1280,798244842,"Recognize what’s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that’s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses."
1281,798244842,"At the same time, independent media represents a shift in consciousness."
1282,798244842,"A shift in our perceptions, thoughts, feelings and general self-awareness about our own planet is changing, and thus, change has been sprouted in multiple different areas, including political corruption and the stranglehold it has over our world."
1283,798244842,"We are more aware, but there is still some ways to go…"
1284,798244842,A good chunk of work has been done.
1285,798244842,A massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass.
1286,798244842,"The censorship of independent media is irrelevant in a sense, because the shift will continue to happen, change will continue to happen, and information that the deep state does not want the public to become aware of will keep making its way into transparency."
1287,798244842,Independent media will continue to have the opportunity to share information because of a lack of credible information and plain truth within the mainstream.
1288,798244842,"People are hungry for it, and will seek it out themselves."

1312,999001259,"Brian Kemp, her Republican challenger, issued a statement a day earlier calling for Abrams to concede."
1313,999001259,Kemp has declared victory and said it is “mathematically impossible” for her campaign to force a runoff.
1314,999001259,Abrams’ campaign did not immediately respond to a phone call from Fox News late Monday night.
1315,999001259,"Abrams, 44, a Democrat, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 votes tallied over the weekend that favored her."
1316,999001259,"Totenberg, who was appointed by President Obama, ruled in connection to Common Cause’s lawsuit filed on Nov. 5."
1317,999001259,Totenberg’s order doesn’t change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results.
1318,999001259,"Common Cause, a nonpartisan group, claimed in the suit that Kemp, while secretary of state, failed to maintain “the security of voter information despite known vulnerabilities” leading up to the midterm."
1319,999001259,"The suit blasted the state’s “provisional ballot scheme,” that could disenfranchise a registered voter at the ballot box."
1320,999001259,The suit pointed out cases where voters were turned around after computer glitches and cases where voters were not offered provisional ballots.
1321,999001259,One man voted for decades and was “disturbed” to learn his registration history was erased.
1322,999001259,The court ruled that the secretary of state’s office must establish a hotline and publicize it on its website for voters to see if their provisional ballots were counted.
1323,999001259,"Totenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law."
1324,999001259,“I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it.
1325,999001259,"I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,” Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history."
1326,999001259,"A total of 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the state during the midterm, 12,151 were cast in 2014."
1327,999001259,"Four Democratic-leaning counties with the largest number of provisional ballots — Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett – “had not yet reported their numbers to the secretary as of November 11,” the suit said."
1328,999001259,The lawsuit also asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in another county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct.
1329,999001259,"The lawsuit says that of the 1,556 provisional ballots Fulton County reported having rejected by Nov. 9, nearly 1,000 were disqualified because they were cast by voters whose registration records showed them registered in another county."
1330,999001259,"Edgardo Cortes, who currently works as an election security adviser at New York University, said these uncounted provisional ballots could sway the election and, despite Kemp’s claims, his unofficial vote total is so close to 50 percent, a runoff is possible."
1331,999001259,Kemp was up 50.2 percent to Abrams’ 48.7 percent early Tuesday.
1332,999001259,"More than 3.9 million votes were cast in the election, and Abrams would need to acquire more than 20,000 additional votes to force a runoff."
1333,999001259,"Abrams’ campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push the deadline for counties to certify their results to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for “arbitrary reasons.”"

1336,738781754,Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.
1337,738781754,Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he plans to do everything in his power to block President Donald Trump’s nominations to head the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency over war and torture concerns.
1338,738781754,We told you about Trump’s administration shake-ups and new nominees Tuesday:
1339,738781754,"Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced."
1340,738781754,"Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State."
1341,738781754,He will do a fantastic job!
1342,738781754,Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!
1343,738781754,"Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen."
1344,738781754,Congratulations to all!” This is yet another big shake-up for Trump’s still-young administration — and it may be the most important one to date.
1345,738781754,The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.
1346,738781754,"“I will oppose both Pompeo’s nomination and Haspel’s nomination,” Paul said Wednesday."
1347,738781754,The Kentucky lawmaker is the first Republican to say he will attempt to block the nominees; but he isn’t the first Republican to express concern.
1348,738781754,Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Tuesday that he wanted answers about Haspel’s background running CIA torture programs prior to her confirmation.
1349,738781754,Paul contends that the Trump nominations directly contradict promises the president made on the campaign trail.
1350,738781754,“I’m perplexed by the nomination of people who love the Iraq War so much that they would advocate for a war with Iran next.
1351,738781754,"I think it goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on,” he said."
1352,738781754,"The lawmaker added that he can’t support Haspel, whom he described as having expressed “joyful glee” at being involved in torture programs in the past."
1353,738781754,"“I find it just amazing that anyone would consider having this woman at the head of the CIA,” Paul said."
1354,738781754,"With Paul’s defection and McCain likely to be undergoing treatment for brain cancer at the time of the vote, Trump’s White House will likely be left scurrying for Democrat support to secure the majority necessary for the nominees to be confirmed in the Senate."

1387,779309765,"This incident, on the other hand, received very little coverage, and hardly any that touched on the Islamic aspects of the story."
1388,779309765,"But Muslim claims of victimhood are so polished and reflexive by now, and the Leftist acceptance of them so matter-of-fact and instinctive, that Judge Sarah Backus fell right into line."

1454,738447109,"Keeping things moving, and I think a lot of us can just shout out, “What are you thinking?” as President Donald Trump brings CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a man that blasted the likes of Edward Snowden for revealing the crimes of our government, to the State Department and installs Gina Haspel in the position of head of the Central Intelligence Agency."
1455,738447109,Trump tweeted out the news on Tuesday.
1456,738447109,"“Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State."
1457,738447109,He will do a fantastic job!

1466,738447109,"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018"
1467,738447109,The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.
1468,738447109,Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.
1469,738447109,"Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy."
1470,738447109,"Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president."
1471,738447109,"His voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their “honesty and integrity” and the American people for “acts of kindness,” and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy."
1472,738447109,But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.
1473,738447109,Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring “an orderly and smooth transition.” The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: “Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.”
1474,738447109,﻿
1475,738447109,CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:
1476,738447109,"On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave."
1477,738447109,"He “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added."
1478,738447109,Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.
1479,738447109,"The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service."
1480,738447109,"Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP."
1481,738447109,Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
1482,738447109,Trump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat “will be much happier now.”
1483,738447109,"While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC."
1484,738447109,"Speaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State."
1485,738447109,“The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up.

1516,788626289,"By contrast, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Brett Kavanaugh abused Christine Blasey Ford."
1517,788626289,"But while the Democrats are in a lather over Ford and Kavanaugh, demanding a delay of the confirmation vote until after the midterm elections that they are sure will go their way, they couldn’t care less about Karen Monahan."

1531,788626289,Karen Monahan’s account in the doctor’s report is consistent with what she has been saying publicly since August: that Ellison was emotionally and physically abusive to her while the two were dating.
1532,788626289,Ellison is the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is the Democratic nominee for Minnesota attorney general.
1533,788626289,He has adamantly denied emotionally or physically abusing Monahan.
1534,788626289,"“She states that she was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated,” reads the November 2017 report, a picture of which Monahan posted on Twitter."

1537,788626289,Ellison’s congressional office did not immediately return a request for comment.
1538,788626289,The Democratic Party has maintained its support for Ellison’s attorney general campaign despite the allegations.
1539,788626289,DNC Chair Tom Perez previously said the committee was “reviewing” the allegations.

1582,794141509,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/11/facebook-purged-over-accounts-pages-pushing-political-messages-profit/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fa1a364488b3
1583,794141509,"But of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!)"
1584,794141509,"as do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to “Facebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.”"
1585,794141509,The fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.
1586,794141509,"Of course, the best coverage of this is from…Russia."
1587,794141509,Sputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.
1588,794141509,"You may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic."
1589,794141509,My friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project.
1590,794141509,He said:
1591,794141509,This signifies a re-consolidation of the media.
1592,794141509,"Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves."
1593,794141509,"This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation."
1594,794141509,Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.
1595,794141509,"So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news."
1596,794141509,"People think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don’t see the families struggling to have their voice heard."
1597,794141509,"For example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim’s side of the story."
1598,794141509,"We give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check."
1599,794141509,This also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.
1600,794141509,(source)
1601,794141509,Nicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly.
1602,794141509,He’s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies.
1603,794141509,He told Sputnik:
1604,794141509,Our approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti-war voices and stories.
1605,794141509,All of our content is professionally fact-checked and edited.
1606,794141509,I got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics.
1607,794141509,I wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy.
1608,794141509,"Over the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook."
1609,794141509,"The timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections."
1610,794141509,This could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections.
1611,794141509,The Twitter suspension caught me by surprise.
1612,794141509,I can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections.
1613,794141509,(source)
1614,794141509,"Remember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms."
1615,794141509,Remember when this happened to Alex Jones?
1616,794141509,"Back in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame."
1617,794141509,"All of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers."
1618,794141509,"I wrote at the time, “Alex Jones is just the beginning of this purge."
1619,794141509,It’s going to get much worse.”
1620,794141509,"Meanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and “shadow banning.”"
1621,794141509,Infowars is a massive profit machine.
1622,794141509,But what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?
1623,794141509,It hits us right in the wallet.
1624,794141509,"And if they’re hit hard enough, they’ll cease to be able to function."
1625,794141509,"Jones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business."
1626,794141509,"And to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses."
1627,794141509,It’s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.
1628,794141509,I know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.
1629,794141509,A site as big as Jones’s would be many times that amount.
1630,794141509,"When all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn’t be hard for a site – and the dissent and information they share – to cease to exist."
1631,794141509,(source)
1632,794141509,This is not just about Facebook or Twitter.
1633,794141509,"It’s about the ability to find dissenting information, period."
1634,794141509,Google is in on it too.
1635,794141509,A leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.
1636,794141509,"Another Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart."
1637,794141509,"The news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled “The Good Censor,” advises tech companies to “police tone instead of content” and to not “take sides” when censoring users… Google might continue to shift with the times – changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures)."
1638,794141509,"If it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential."
1639,794141509,"Shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users’ fury… The Google “internal research” even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police “tone instead of content” and “censor everyone equally,” as Breitbart put it."
1640,794141509,(source)
1641,794141509,There are 2 trillion Google searches per day.
1642,794141509,PER.
1643,794141509,DAY.
1644,794141509,That should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.
1645,794141509,Combine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.
1646,794141509,This is where free thought goes to die.
1647,794141509,Ron Paul reminds us that truth is treason.
1648,794141509,"Ron Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:"
1649,794141509,"“You get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,” Paul told the Russia-based news outlet."
1650,794141509,"“Challenging the status quo is what they can’t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.” “Some of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we’re speaking out of line and they’d like to punish us, and I think that’s part of what’s happening with social media,” Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their “dependency” on the current social media platforms."
1651,794141509,"“I’m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,” Paul added."
1652,794141509,(source)
1653,794141509,Here’s a video from last month with Dr. Paul’s thoughts about the social media purge.
1654,794141509,"In it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish."
1655,794141509,The danger – and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment – is their direct ties to the government.
1656,794141509,This affects everyone.
1657,794141509,"If you’re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don’t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you’re missing the bigger point."
1658,794141509,"Consider the fact that the “population” of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined."
1659,794141509,"That’s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events."
1660,794141509,People will believe what they’re told because there is no alternative information presented.
1661,794141509,There are no questions asked.
1662,794141509,It’s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.
1663,794141509,Definition of brainwashing
1664,794141509,"1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)"
1665,794141509,"(Here’s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)"
1666,794141509,Social media is a massive source of information and influence today.
1667,794141509,"If the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we’re doomed."
1668,794141509,2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.
1669,794141509,"So regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree."
1670,794141509,"It will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like “the government is your friend” and that “you don’t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.”"
1671,794141509,People who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.
1672,794141509,That should scare the crap out of you.
1673,794141509,What can you do about the alternative media purge?
1674,794141509,It’s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.
1675,794141509,"But even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further."
1676,794141509,Here are a few things you can do:
1677,794141509,Subscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.
1678,794141509,Don’t count on seeing their work on social media.
1679,794141509,"(You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)"
1680,794141509,Support them financially if you can.
1681,794141509,Many sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons
1682,794141509,"Bookmark them and visit regularly – if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat."
1683,794141509,Share their articles on your own social media accounts.
1684,794141509,"If they can’t get their work out there, we can help."
1685,794141509,Join alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.
1686,794141509,The truth is getting harder and harder to find.
1687,794141509,You’re going to have to dig for it.
1688,794141509,We’re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.
1689,794141509,The alternative media purge is just the beginning.
1690,794141509,And we should all be very concerned.

1712,763412406,"In his speech, he encouraged those listening that they were not alone, and said the gathering of the people was meant to be a voice to the UK government to ""Free Tommy Robinson!"""
1713,763412406,"Batten echoed that sentiment saying, “Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner."""
1714,763412406,"“Whatever the legal technicalities of his alleged contempt of court, he was imprisoned more for who he is and what he says rather than what he is supposed to have done.,"" he added."

1716,763412406,"He then went on to blast the policies of the UK that are truly harming their own people, specifically “widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls by organized gangs” while those in authority “brush it under the carpet.”"
1717,763412406,"“Governments in this country and across Europe are now the enemies of their own people, [and] they promote policies that are against the interests of their own people,” he railed — citing efforts to sabotage Brexit, uncontrolled mass migration, and what he described as “Islamisation” in particular,"" he said."
1718,763412406,"“A literalist interpretation of the Mohammedan cult is completely alien to everything our country stands for and our traditional way of life,"" Batten continued."
1719,763412406,"“And yet instead of opposing Islamisation, our government is submitting and surrendering to it."
1720,763412406,"They have betrayed the British people."""
1721,763412406,"“Now, ‘Islam’ means ‘Submission’."
1722,763412406,"You either submit, or you resist."

1724,763412406,“Are you going to resist?”
1725,763412406,The crowd shouted back their support of resisting and not submitting to the Islamization of their culture.
1726,763412406,Sharia Watch founder Anne Marie Waters also spoke at the rally.
1727,763412406,"“Our leaders, our media, our police, all prioritize Islam in their decision-making,” she said."
1728,763412406,"“Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom?"
1729,763412406,Why is it so much easier to jail Tommy Robinson?
1730,763412406,"“Why is it so easy to jail a man for leaving bacon at a mosque, but so difficult to jail jihadis who preach murder and death to the British people?"""

1743,763412406,Why?” Waters asked.
1744,763412406,"Well, the questions are obviously rhetorical."
1745,763412406,We know why.
1746,763412406,"The UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there."

1854,999001290,"A Trump appointed federal judge has order the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after the White House revoked it for his badgering of the White House press secretary, his handling of a White House aide and his continual questioning when he was allowed to ask a question and follow up."
1855,999001290,"The ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you."
1856,999001290,USA Today reported on the ruling:
1857,999001290,"WASHINGTON – A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump."
1858,999001290,"U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision."
1859,999001290,Kelly said White House officials couldn’t say who made the decision or how.
1860,999001290,"The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case – which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY – is argued."
1861,999001290,"“This court cannot restore Mr. Acosta’s access to press briefings that have already been held,” Kelly said."
1862,999001290,But Kelly said he hasn’t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta’s First Amendment rights.
1863,999001290,More arguments are expected Tuesday.
1864,999001290,“I trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.” Kelly said.
1865,999001290,What?
1866,999001290,Due process?
1867,999001290,"Wait, Acosta was not charged with a crime."

1904,999001290,"We’re doing that, were going to write them up right now."
1905,999001290,"It’s not a big deal and if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference."""
1906,999001290,"In speaking about the rules and regulations the White House is writing up, Trump added, ""We’re writing them now."
1907,999001290,"We’ll have rules of decorum, you know you can’t keep asking questions."
1908,999001290,"We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he’s supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and you know just shouting out questions and making statements, too."""
1909,999001290,"You know that isn't going to stop someone like Acosta, who claimed to deal in facts and truth, but clearly demonstrated he was all about lies when it came to putting his hands on a White House aide."
1910,999001290,The order by Judge Kelly is a temporary one that lasts for 14 days.
1911,999001290,"“I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave,"" Trump continued."
1912,999001290,"""I will say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I’ll leave."
1913,999001290,And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that’s acting up.”
1914,999001290,White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement following the judge's ruling on Thursday.
1915,999001290,"“Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House."
1916,999001290,"In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass."
1917,999001290,We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.
1918,999001290,There must be decorum at the White House.”
1919,999001290,"Well, I can't wait to see the next press conference."
1920,999001290,Perhaps there is an easier way around all of this.
1921,999001290,"Perhaps from now on, President Trump should ignore Jim Acosta and take anyone and everyone else's questions in the room but his questions."

1952,777785889,"TAOS COUNTY, NEW MEXICO — Two males from Georgia are in custody after TCSO served a search warrant at a makeshift residence that is best described as a “compound” in Amalia, NM."
1953,777785889,Eleven children ranging in age from 1 to 15-years-old were also taken in protective custody and later turned over to New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department (CYFD) for their own health and safety.
1954,777785889,Three women believed to be the children’s mothers were also arrested.
1955,777785889,"Thursday afternoon Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe swore out an affidavit for a search warrant that states there is a makeshift compound surrounded by tires and an earthen berm in Costilla Meadows subdivision that he reasonably believed was occupied by adult Lucas Morton and others, including 39-year-old Siraj Wahhaj, who was wanted for child abduction and 3-year-old AG Wahhaj, the child that was abducted."
1956,777785889,"This warrant came after a two-month investigation in conjunction with Clayton County, Georgia and FBI investigators."
1957,777785889,"According to Sheriff Hogrefe the FBI had recently provided information and surveillance on this location, but they (FBI) didn’t feel there was enough probable cause to get on the property."
1958,777785889,"In the press release Sheriff Hogrefe said, “That all changed for me when a message was forwarded to us from a Georgia Detective that we reasonably believed came from someone at the compound – the message sent to a third party simply said in part “we are starving and need food and water”."
1959,777785889,"I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible, so I began working on a search warrant right after I got that intercepted message – it had to be a search warrant and a tactical approach for our own safety because we had learned the occupants were most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief."
1960,777785889,We also knew from the layout of the compound they would have an advantage if we didn’t deploy tactfully and quickly.”
1961,777785889,"On Friday morning, August 3, 2018, eight members of TCSO’s Sheriff’s Response Team (SRT) were assisted by four members of the State OSI unit when they executed the search warrant."
1962,777785889,"The “all day” operation went without major incident or any injuries, but when encountered both men initially refused to follow verbal direction and Wahhaj who was held up inside the compound was heavily armed with an AR15 rifle, five loaded 30 round magazines, and four loaded pistols, including one in his pocket when he was taken down."
1963,777785889,"Many more rounds of ammo were found in the makeshift compound that consists of a small travel trailer buried in the ground covered by plastic with no water, plumbing, or electricity."
1964,777785889,"“The only food We saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer,” said Hogrefe."
1965,777785889,"“But what was most surprising, and heartbreaking was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing.”"
1966,777785889,"The body of a yound boy was also located, however, it is not clear if the boy is the missing child from Georgia."
1967,777785889,Both males were arrested; Morton was charged with harboring a fugitive and Wahhaj was booked on his no bond Georgia warrant for child abduction.
1968,777785889,"The three females believed to be the mothers of the eleven children, Jany Leveille age 35, Hujrah Wahhaj age 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj age 35 were arrested without incident in Taos and were later booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center."
1969,777785889,“We all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had – it was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen.”
1970,777785889,"None of the adults would give statement to the current whereabouts of AG Wahhaj, but it is reasonably believed he was there a few weeks ago."
1971,777785889,The investigation is fluid and ongoing.

1995,790499380,The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation.
1996,790499380,"Ellingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works."
1997,790499380,DFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon.
1998,790499380,Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
1999,790499380,"After the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened."
2000,790499380,“All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.
2001,790499380,"We are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,” a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further."
2002,790499380,"The Democratic Party’s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday."
2003,790499380,"The firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings."
2004,790499380,The contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.
2005,790499380,As we previously reported:
2006,790499380,"Rep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan."
2007,790499380,"Austin Monahan, Karen Monahan’s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night."
2008,790499380,"According to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through “pure hell.” In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her."
2009,790499380,"The alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned."
2010,790499380,"State Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D-Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to “answer these allegations.” DFL-endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations “extremely troubling.” Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her “kids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.” Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story."
2011,790499380,"Ellison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse."
2012,790499380,And the relationship was clearly real.
2013,790499380,"Karen Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years."
2014,790499380,"The two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House."
2015,790499380,Records show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended.
2016,790499380,"Ellison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced."
2017,790499380,It's hard to know what really happened in a relationship.
2018,790499380,And the media has kept it quiet.
2019,790499380,"""Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend."
2020,790499380,"The story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran."
2021,790499380,"It blew up last night after the ex’s son posted the allegation on Facebook."""
2022,790499380,Dave Weigel.
2023,790499380,It's not quite the first time for Keith X.
2024,790499380,This is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations.
2025,790499380,"In 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s."
2026,790499380,Ellison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment.
2027,790499380,"She subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation."
2028,790499380,Ellison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him.
2029,790499380,I'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections.
2030,790499380,Ellison won the primary days after the allegations were made public.
2031,790499380,"Of course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh."
2032,790499380,"However, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report."
2033,790499380,"When it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy who simply does not want to answer to the American people and even seeks security to hide from a female report with a mic and a camera."
2034,790499380,Judge Kavanaugh has faced it all and fought back against it.

2131,738361208,"Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah."
2132,738361208,"Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations."
2133,738361208,"The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane."

2136,777869943,Couple question why police waited so long to search New Mexico compound
2137,777869943,(CNN) A New Mexico couple told authorities months ago they thought a missing Georgia boy and his fugitive father were living in a filthy compound on their property.
2138,777869943,"But police did not carry out a search of the property until last week, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said, because they did not believe they had probable cause in the case."
2139,777869943,That delay is facing scrutiny in the wake of Monday's discovery of a young boy's remains at the compound.
2140,777869943,"""They were dragging their feet."
2141,777869943,"They were taking too long,"" said Tanya Badger, who with her husband, Jason, told authorities about the boy's suspected presence at the compound."
2142,777869943,"""Even if they were trying to build a case or whatnot, a child's life is at stake."""
2143,777869943,"It's not clear whether the remains are those of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a child with severe medical problems who disappeared from Georgia about nine months ago."
2144,777869943,"The remains were discovered in a wretched compound along with 11 starving children, authorities said."
2145,777869943,More details about the horrid compound could be revealed Wednesday when the five adults arrested from the site make their first court appearances.
2146,777869943,"Authorities raided the compound in Amalia, New Mexico, on Friday as part of their search for Abdul-Ghani, whose father, Siraj Wahhaj, allegedly abducted him from Georgia in November."
2147,777869943,Neighbors raised alarm about a suspect
2148,777869943,"The Badgers , whose land the compound was on, said they saw a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani in January and February."
2149,777869943,"In April, they discovered the boy was listed as missing and his father a fugitive."
2150,777869943,"They reported the sightings to state and local law enforcement, but it was months before police moved in, the couple said."
2151,777869943,"""We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long,"" Tanya Badger said."
2152,777869943,"New Mexico authorities had suspected the father and son might be at the compound after learning about the abduction in May, the sheriff said."
2153,777869943,"But there was not enough evidence for a search warrant, and surveillance of the property didn't identify the pair there."
2154,777869943,"""I had no probable cause to go onto this property,"" Hogrefe said."
2155,777869943,"""In hindsight I wish there was, but we would not have been there lawfully."""
2156,777869943,"The sheriff said that ""they did surveillance, both ground and aerial, and photographs were shared with the family and mother of the missing boy."
2157,777869943,The boy Abdul was never identified from those photos.
2158,777869943,"Moving forward we knew that there was this compound, but we had very little details about it or who was occupying it."
2159,777869943,"These people just kind of (sprang) up very quickly."""
2160,777869943,"The authorities' view changed Thursday when they said they received a message about possible starving children living on the compound, and had enough probable cause to put in an affidavit for a search warrant."
2161,777869943,"""We are starving and need food and water,"" the message said, according to authorities."
2162,777869943,Authorities said it was forwarded to them but did not provide details on its origin.
2163,777869943,"Compound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say"
2164,777869943,"When officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene."
2165,777869943,"Stacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound."
2166,777869943,Obscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living.
2167,777869943,"The children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said."
2168,777869943,"""It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,"" Hogrefe said."
2169,777869943,"The father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults -- Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille."
2170,777869943,All have been charged with abuse of the 11 children.
2171,777869943,Morten was charged with harboring a fugitive.
2172,777869943,"However, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property."
2173,777869943,The couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul-Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid.
2174,777869943,Tanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.
2175,777869943,They said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched.
2176,777869943,"They found two guns, ammo, tactical vests and video cameras that police initially missed, Jason Badger said."
2177,777869943,"""When we first went up there, nothing was overturned,"" he said."
2178,777869943,"""You could tell nobody had looked underneath that, nobody had looked underneath this."""
2179,777869943,Father allegedly took boy in November
2180,777869943,"Abdul-Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains."
2181,777869943,"But hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children"
2182,777869943,"""My husband said he was taking Abdul-Ghani to the park, and didn't come back."
2183,777869943,That was in November 2017.
2184,777869943,"When I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night."
2185,777869943,"But I haven't seen him since then,"" Ramzi said Tuesday."
2186,777869943,"She said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention."
2187,777869943,"An arrest warrant states that Wahhaj ""wanted to perform an exorcism"" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil."
2188,777869943,But Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya -- an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness.
2189,777869943,"""It's not an exorcism."
2190,777869943,"That was a translation issue in the court,"" Ramzi said."
2191,777869943,"He ""just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better."""
2192,777869943,Police stopped the father in Alabama
2193,777869943,"In December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report."
2194,777869943,The SUV had seven children -- but none of them was listed with Abdul-Ghani's date of birth.

2239,787730392,"“Federal Judge Denies New Mexico Compound Residents Bail,” by Vanessa Romo, KRWG, September 13, 2018:"
2240,787730392,A federal judge denied bail on Wednesday to all five members of an extended family accused of operating a training camp for a violent attack on public institutions out of their isolated New Mexico compound.
2241,787730392,"During the arraignment hearing, Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa told the defendants there was “clear and convincing evidence that you are a danger to the community,” The Associated Press reported."
2242,787730392,"A federal grand jury indicted the group on Tuesday on conspiracy and federal firearms charges stemming from the discovery of a cache of weapons after law enforcement raided their home in search of a missing boy but, instead, found 11 malnourished children living in squalid conditions."
2243,787730392,"Federal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had “a common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.” U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI’s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants’ home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy."
2244,787730392,"According to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared “to engage in jihad and … to die as martyrs.”… Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client."
2245,787730392,"If the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, “No one would bat an eye,” Thomas Clark argued in court."
2246,787730392,"“If these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that’s not a big deal because there’s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country."
2247,787730392,"If these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country."

2256,790666929,But the Democrat machine got them unsealed anyway.

2274,790666929,"The Star Tribune has joined a legal effort to unseal the divorce records of U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic candidate for attorney general."
2275,790666929,"Ellison and his ex-wife, Kim Ellison, divorced in 2012."
2276,790666929,"The related records have been sealed, so the public cannot access the information."
2277,790666929,"The Star Tribune’s motion to intervene and unseal the records follows a similar action by Alpha News, a right-leaning online news and opinion site."
2278,790666929,"The efforts follow allegations by Ellison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that Ellison domestically abused her in 2016."
2279,790666929,"He has denied the allegation repeatedly, and Monahan has continued to press her case in frequent tweets about Ellison."
2280,790666929,"On Sunday, Monahan tweeted to Ellison: “This is not going away and you are making it worse for you, your family and district by lying, smearing, getting others to do your dirty work, victim shaming, etc.” She referred again to a video she says she has of Ellison dragging her off a bed, which he has said did not happen."
2281,790666929,"She has declined to show the video, saying it is traumatizing."
2282,790666929,She also told CNN she misplaced it.
2283,790666929,Monahan also recently released a medical record that shows she told a doctor in 2017 that she had been in an abusive relationship with Ellison.
2284,790666929,"Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, said Tuesday that the party’s investigation of the allegations against Ellison will be finished soon, then released to the public."
2285,790666929,An external investigator was hired to conduct the inquiry.
2286,790666929,"The Star Tribune argued that, given the public interest around that situation and Kim Ellison’s public support of her ex-husband, the divorce records are a matter of concern to voters."
2287,790666929,"Divorce records are typically public, but judges will often agree to seal them if both parties to the case agree and no one else objects."
2288,790666929,The Ellison campaign released a statement from Kim Ellison on behalf of both her and Keith Ellison.
2289,790666929,"“Our divorce simply isn’t the public’s business, and therefore, when we separated, we jointly asked the court to seal the file."
2290,790666929,"Now, one month before a closely contested election for Minnesota Attorney General, a conservative group wants to probe our divorce file in search of something to use against Keith in this race."

2351,789512681,Cop Killer Supporter Keith Ellison Calls Cops To Protect Him From Female Journalist Armed With Mic & Camera Phone
2352,789512681,Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is the epitome of an effeminate man today in America.
2353,789512681,"He stands accused by two women who claim that he not only verbally abused them, but physically assaulted them as well, and no, these women didn't wait decades or even till there was a politically opportune time to voice their accusations."
2354,789512681,One even had reported him to the police.
2355,789512681,Investigative journalist Laura Loomer was informed by police in Minnesota that he wanted police protection from her when he found out she was attending the education forum that was held Saturday.
2356,789512681,"This is a man who follows a demonic religion, Islam, and supports cop killers."
2357,789512681,"He does all of this while he stands accused of abusing women and running to be attorney general in Minnesota, even though he possesses no attorney's license that is valid."

2373,789512681,"On Saturday, there was an education panel at the Education Minnesota Apple Valley open to union members and guests."
2374,789512681,"Prior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was ""protected"" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone ."
2375,789512681,Loomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night.
2376,789512681,She stood alongside other female survivors of abuse.
2377,789512681,Ellison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene.
2378,789512681,"At least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions."
2379,789512681,"Failing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no ""member's only"" elevator to flee into."
2380,789512681,"Finally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse."
2381,789512681,"The irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood."
2382,789512681,Scott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals.
2383,789512681,Ellison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress.
2384,789512681,"(I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.)"
2385,789512681,Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006.
2386,789512681,"In his 2014 memoir My Country, ’Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam."
2387,789512681,"This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, “I worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so."
2388,789512681,That’s it.” But that wasn’t it.
2389,789512681,"Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam."
2390,789512681,(Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)
2391,789512681,"Fortunately for him, Ellison’s 5th District constituents haven’t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it."
2392,789512681,But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.
2393,789512681,Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison’s career: support for cop killers.
2394,789512681,"In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis."
2395,789512681,"Police later determined that Haaf’s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city’s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace."
2396,789512681,The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis’s house.
2397,789512681,Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.
2398,789512681,"At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice."
2399,789512681,"And within a month of Haaf’s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front."
2400,789512681,"In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace."
2401,789512681,"“The main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,” said Ellison."
2402,789512681,Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration.
2403,789512681,"According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years."
2404,789512681,"“If the police have some fear, I understand that fear,” Willis said."
2405,789512681,“We seem to have an overabundance of bad police.
2406,789512681,.
2407,789512681,.
2408,789512681,.
2409,789512681,"[W]e’re going to get rid of them,” Willis said."
2410,789512681,“They’ve got to go.” The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison’s contribution to the demonstration: “Ellison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.
2411,789512681,"That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.” Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants."
2412,789512681,"In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial."
2413,789512681,"Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf’s cold-blooded murder: “We don’t get no justice, you don’t get no peace.” Ellison’s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years."
2414,789512681,The Haaf case wasn’t an aberration for Ellison.
2415,789512681,"In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served—the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975."
2416,789512681,(The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.
2417,789512681,Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.)
2418,789512681,"In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and “Assata Shakur” (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973."
2419,789512681,Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.
2420,789512681,Bryan Burrough’s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard’s terrorist career.
2421,789512681,"In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List."
2422,789512681,"The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture."
2423,789512681,"Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: “I am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they’re going to get Assata Shakur, they’re going to get a whole lot of other people,” he told the crowd."
2424,789512681,"“I hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.” Ellison’s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable."
2425,789512681,He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.
2426,789512681,"Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (“Field Marshal Cinque”), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a “black gang member” and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution."
2427,789512681,He described her as one of those who had been “fighting for freedom in the ‘60s and’70s” and called for her release.
2428,789512681,"Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento."
2429,789512681,"According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight."
2430,789512681,The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.
2431,789512681,Seems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.

2434,832917532,Robert Mueller Not Recommending Any More Indictments
2435,832917532,"Special counsel Robert Mueller will not recommend any more indictments as part of his investigation, the Justice Department announced Friday evening."
2436,832917532,A senior Justice Department official announced the development shortly after the special counsel submitted its final report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
2437,832917532,Barr will now review the report and write his own report on Mueller’s findings and present them to Congress as soon as this weekend.
2438,832917532,"“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees."
2439,832917532,He also said at no time did the Justice Department prevent Mueller from any actions he sought to make during the course of his investigation.
2440,832917532,"President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery is that he is “glad it’s over,” reported ABC News."
2441,832917532,"In a separate statement, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow said:“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations."
2442,832917532,Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”
2443,832917532,"Following confirmation of the report’s delivery, several top Democrat lawmakers demanded its immediate public release."
2444,832917532,"Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mueller’s findings “must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public."
2445,832917532,Nothing short of that will suffice.”
2446,832917532,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) echoed Warner’s remarks, stating: “It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.”"
2447,832917532,"Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the former chair of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement “that we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion.”"
2448,832917532,“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.
2449,832917532,"Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said."
2450,832917532,"“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries.”"

2530,786004130,The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.
2531,786004130,"At some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim."

2539,786004130,Does Guyger leave her door unlocked?
2540,786004130,"Furthermore, The Dallas News reports:"
2541,786004130,"Jean, who lived on the fourth floor of the South Side Flats in the Cedars, was home alone when Guyger mistook his apartment for hers, the affidavit says."
2542,786004130,"Guyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says."
2543,786004130,"When she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says."
2544,786004130,"The door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit."
2545,786004130,"The affidavit says the apartments' ""respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar."""
2546,786004130,"The apartment was dark and when she saw ""a large silhouette,"" Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says."
2547,786004130,"The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, ""gave verbal commands that were ignored"" and fired twice."
2548,786004130,Jean was struck once in the torso.
2549,786004130,Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid.
2550,786004130,"She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says."
2551,786004130,"She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit."
2552,786004130,"Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar."
2553,786004130,Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?
2554,786004130,"In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody."
2555,786004130,"This was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, ""she is devastated."""
2556,786004130,Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend.
2557,786004130,"In fact, this is not her first shooting."
2558,786004130,"As a four-year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017."
2559,786004130,The Dallas News reported:
2560,786004130,"In 2017, Guyger shot 47-year-old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her."
2561,786004130,Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest.
2562,786004130,"When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit."
2563,786004130,"One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said."
2564,786004130,Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her.
2565,786004130,"After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said."
2566,786004130,Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting.
2567,786004130,"Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole."
2568,786004130,"In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison."
2569,786004130,The Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation.
2570,786004130,"USA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20-year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine."

2599,999001256,Are these evidence of the erosion of the democratic process?
2600,999001256,"Sure they are and they appear to all be coming from the party that Stacey Abrams represents, but she's not going to talk about that."
2601,999001256,But she wasn't going to concede.
2602,999001256,"Nope, that arrogant wanna-be first female governor of Georgia simply would not bow out gracefully."
2603,999001256,"“To watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling,” Abrams said."
2604,999001256,"“So, let’s be clear,"" she continued."
2605,999001256,"""This is not a speech of concession."
2606,999001256,"Because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper."
2607,999001256,"As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that."
2608,999001256,But my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy.”
2609,999001256,"No, concession means ""a thing that is granted, especially in response to demands; a thing conceded."""
2610,999001256,Abrams was easily defeated in terms of votes.
2611,999001256,"She was the one trying to ""find"" and count votes remember?"
2612,999001256,She is the one claiming there was cancellation of hundreds of thousands of voter registrations.
2613,999001256,Where is her evidence?
2614,999001256,She has none.
2615,999001256,Stacey Abrams is a sore loser just like Hillary Clinton and this little temper tantrum she put on display will probably sink any chances she may have had in the future to run again.
2616,999001256,Good!

2621,999001280,"Of course, Infowars' Paul Joseph Watson simply enhanced the video from C-SPAN, which was a gif image (motion picture), in order to show the point of contact that the lying media and ""fact checkers"" said didn't occur."
2622,999001280,Watson then went on to be happy that President Trump backed him up on his comments about the video.

2649,999001280,"But it's more than that, self-proclaimed ""fact checkers"" like Snopes simply posted an Associated Press article, which clearly biased towards indicating the video was ""doctored"" by saying it was sped up, but that's not doctoring."

2681,999000874,CNN Sues Trump Demanding He Restore Jim Acosta’s White House Credential
2682,999000874,CNN sues President Trump and top White House aides for barring Jim Acosta.
2683,999000874,557 SHARES Facebook Twitter
2684,999000874,CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the revocation of press credentials from its reporter Jim Acosta demanding they be restored.
2685,999000874,The suit alleges the ban violated both First and Fifth Amendment rights of the network and reporter.
2686,999000874,Last Wednesday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made the announcement that Acosta’s press pass had been suspended as a result of an altercation during a press conference when Acosta refused to give up the microphone after several requests by President Trump to hand it over.
2687,999000874,"Not only did Acosta refuse to hand over the microphone, but he pushed the female interns hand away when she tried to follow the presidents request to take the microphone away from Acosta, who has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman."

2700,999000874,"Watching the full exchange it is obvious that Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before losing his patients with an argumentative Acosta who refused to hand the mic over to the female intern forcefully pushing her arm away."
2701,999000874,"Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line."
2702,999000874,The lawsuit was announced by CNN on Tuesday.
2703,999000874,The network is also asking the court for an “immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim.”
2704,999000874,"Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and there are six defendants: Donald Trump himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Chief of Staff John Kelly, his aide for communication Bill Shine, Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, and the unidentified Secret Service officer who took the pass from Acosta."
2705,999000874,Fox News reports:
2706,999000874,"“The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta’s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,” CNN said in a statement."
2707,999000874,"“We have asked the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass to be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.”"
2708,999000874,"CNN added that “the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta,” but said it could happen to anyone."
2709,999000874,"“If left unchallenged, the actions of the White house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials,” CNN said."
2710,999000874,"This morning, CNN filed a lawsuit against @realDonaldTrump and top aides."
2711,999000874,The White House has violated CNN and @Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press and Fifth Amendment rights to due process.

2713,999000874,The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
2714,999000874,"Last week, Acosta’s press pass to access the White House was suspended “until further notice” after he engaged in the contentious back-and-forth over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico."
2715,999000874,"Trump characterizes the caravan as “an invasion,” a term to which Acosta objected."
2716,999000874,"“Honestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,” the president said."
2717,999000874,The reporter tried to ask him another question before a female White House aide walked over to him.
2718,999000874,"Trump then told him, “That’s enough!”"
2719,999000874,Acosta continued to try to talk as the intern was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand.
2720,999000874,She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn’t give it up and there was brief contact between the two.
2721,999000874,White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his “placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.” She called the behavior “absolutely unacceptable.”
2722,999000874,"Several news outlets accused Sanders of using a “doctored” video as evidence, but the press secretary didn’t back down from her decision."
2723,999000874,“We stand by our decision to revoke this individual’s hard pass.
2724,999000874,"We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,” Sanders tweeted to accompany the allegedly doctored video."
2725,999000874,White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway has since said the video was simply “sped up.”
2726,999000874,"An attorney for CNN and Acosta followed up with a separate statement, saying the law is “clear” that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment and Due process Clause."

2728,761722669,"Former President Bill Clinton insisted in a weekend interview that he doesn't owe a personal apology to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose adult life has been defined by their inappropriate sexual affair and the global scrutiny that followed."
2729,761722669,"'No,' he told NBC in an interview airing Monday on the 'Today' show."
2730,761722669,'I do not – I have never talked to her.
2731,761722669,But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.'
2732,761722669,"'I apologized to everybody in the world,' Clinton said, implying that was enough."
2733,761722669,"And the flustered former president, more famous for his Don Juan-like seductions than for his policy legacy, portrayed himself, not Lewinsky, as history's victim in the mass-media's retelling of the 1990s saga."

2739,761722669,"'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,' he declared, 'I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care.'"
2740,761722669,And Clinton complained in the interview that he left the presidency financially ruined because of the costs associated with the legal consequences of his actions.
2741,761722669,"'Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,' he said."
2742,761722669,"'I left the White House $16 million in debt,'"
2743,761722669,"He's worth about $80 million today, aided by an aggressive schedule of speaking events – many of which paid him six-figure fees for individual appearances."
2744,761722669,"In a March essay for Vanity Fair magazine, Lewinsky wrote that 'what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.'"
2745,761722669,Clinton is now on a book tour with co-author James Patterson but got pointed questions from NBC in an interview that aired Monday morning
2746,761722669,"Clinton, pictured denying his May-December affair when he was president, was already noted at the time for his lothario habits"
2747,761722669,"But decades later, she's still traumatized by the aftermath of being identifed globally as the your woman the President of the United States kept on the side and used for his own pleasure just a few feet from the Oval Office."
2748,761722669,"'I’m sorry to say I don’t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation,' Lewinsky wrote of the public humiliation that played out in seeming slow motion."
2749,761722669,'I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me.
2750,761722669,Over and over and over again.'
2751,761722669,"Clinton is launching a book tour to promote 'The President is Missing,' a fictional political thriller co-written with the famed author James Patterson."
2752,761722669,"He accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don't know you don't know them.'"
2753,761722669,'This was litigated 20 years ago.
2754,761722669,Two-thirds of the American people sided with me.'
2755,761722669,"Lewinsky is pictured on September 21, 1998 meeting with then-president Bill Clinton at a White House function"
2756,761722669,"If he were president today, he said later, his most famous extramarital affair wouldn't 'be an issue, because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts.'"
2757,761722669,"Patterson, too, defended Clinton – by comparing his sexual affairs in office with those of two preceding Democratic presidents."
2758,761722669,"'It's 20 years ago, come on!'"
2759,761722669,he blasted Melvin.
2760,761722669,'Let's talk about JFK.
2761,761722669,"Let's talk about, you know, LBJ."
2762,761722669,Stop already!'
2763,761722669,Clinton piled on.

2765,761722669,Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned?
2766,761722669,"Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,' he jabbed."
2767,761722669,"'I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus.'"
2768,761722669,"Suddenly philosophical and seeming to take a longer view of history, Clinton said: 'I have tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work."

2805,788271400,They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system.
2806,788271400,"In Cruz’s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn’t her’s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time—a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz."
2807,788271400,But that is not the case at all.
2808,788271400,Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed?
2809,788271400,"If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her—would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident?"
2810,788271400,"Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO."
2811,788271400,"To shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left."
2812,788271400,"This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong."
2813,788271400,"There is no other way around it, “mistake” or not."
2814,788271400,"From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line."
2815,788271400,Amber Guyger’s home was never searched while Jean’s apartment was searched that night.
2816,788271400,"The results of the blood test to test for alcohol or drugs in her system were never released, yet police — on the day his mother buried her son — claimed they found marijuana in his house."
2817,788271400,It’s been a smear campaign from the beginning and it is this way by design.
2818,788271400,"Amber Guyger took an innocent person’s life, and because people are so blinded by the badge, she is being portrayed as the victim."
2819,788271400,"To those who attempt to claim there is no bias in this horrifically flawed system, if ever there was a case to prove you wrong—this is it."
2820,788271400,A tragedy indeed.

2824,999000851,"Thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules."
2825,999000851,"CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta will get his “hard pass” restored, but thanks to his antics and confrontations with President Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all journalists seeking access to the presidential press room will now have to abide by written rules of conduct due to his misbehavior."
2826,999000851,"Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine sent a letter to Acosta on Monday, notifying him that his hard pass was restored, but that it could be suspended or revoked again if he fails to abide by the new rules that apply to all White House correspondents going forward."
2827,999000851,"Under the rules laid out in the letter, each journalist gets “a single question” before having to yield the floor, with follow-ups solely at the discretion of White House officials."
2828,999000851,"Failure to obey the rules may result in suspension or revocation of the “hard pass,” the document allowing major networks regular access to the White House, RT reports."

2845,999000851,"Acosta’s pass was yanked following an incident at President Donald Trump’s November 7 press conference, where the CNN correspondent argued with Trump instead of asking questions (not for the first time) and physically prevented a White House intern from taking the microphone away from him."
2846,999000851,"CNN responded by suing the White House, claiming that Acosta’s due process and free speech rights were being infringed."

2853,999000851,"This means that Acosta, or any other reporter covering the White House, can get their pass suspended or revoked over specific conduct going forward, without having a leg to stand on in terms of due process."

2858,999000878,It appears that CNN is setting the wheels in motion for a lawsuit against the White House for removing the press credentials of Jim Acosta following a tense incident Wednesday during a news conference at the White House.
2859,999000878,"“I hope I’m not mistaken, but it’s my understanding that CNN and Acosta have sued, that there will be a court hearing on Tuesday on this very matter that we’ve been discussing,” Donaldson said."

2874,999000878,"Donaldson also said that he had sent Acosta an email which encouraged him to ‘Keep it up”, and not to worry about the “vicious attacks” and “threats”."
2875,999000878,CNN released a statement saying no decision has been made as of yet on the lawsuit.
2876,999000878,The network has reached out to the White House on the issue but has “gotten no response”.
2877,999000878,Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” also featured constitutional lawyer Floyd Mayweather who emphasized that CNN would have a “really strong lawsuit” if they chose to proceed.
2878,999000878,Last Wednesday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made the announcement that Acosta’s press pass had been suspended as a result of a tussle with a White House intern over a microphone following his sharp back-and-forth with Trump during the President’s post-midterm Q&A.
2879,999000878,Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman.
2880,999000878,"Watching the full exchange it is obvious that President Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before rightfully losing his patients when Acosta refused to hand the mic over."

2910,787085939,"Dallas, TX — The Dallas Police on Thursday announced the findings of a search warrant they executed on the home of Botham Jean after he was gunned down in his apartment by one of their own."
2911,787085939,The department is now accused of trying to “smear” Jean by claiming they found a tiny bit of marijuana in his house—as if this justifies going into someone’s home and murdering them.
2912,787085939,The timing couldn’t have been more insidiously planned as police released the affidavit on the day of Jean’s funeral—despite having allegedly found the marijuana last week.
2913,787085939,"According to the affidavit, when they searched his home, police claimed to have found 10.4 grams of pot—less than half an ounce."
2914,787085939,"Police also said they found two fired cartridge casings, a police backpack and vest, and a metal marijuana grinder—the horror."
2915,787085939,"Even if police did find marijuana, why on earth would they execute a search warrant on an innocent dead man’s home and then release that information to the public?"

2926,787085939,"“They [police] immediately began looking to smear him,” attorney Lee Merritt said."
2927,787085939,"“I think it’s unfortunate that law enforcement begin to immediately criminalize the victim—in this case, someone who was clearly was the victim that has absolutely no bearing on the fact that he was shot in his home,” Merritt added to Fox 4."
2928,787085939,"Pointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean."
2929,787085939,“I would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him.
2930,787085939,"I haven’t seen any of those,” said Merritt."
2931,787085939,"Merritt accused the department of conducting a “common assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.” Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations."
2932,787085939,It is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye.
2933,787085939,"Even sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time."
2934,787085939,"As the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police — who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake — Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him."
2935,787085939,"“Guyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,” according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon."
2936,787085939,"“She inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole."
2937,787085939,"The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger’s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.”"
2938,787085939,"“Guyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by … Jean,” according to the warrant."
2939,787085939,“Guyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso.
2940,787085939,"Guyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to … Jean."
2941,787085939,"“Due to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911."
2942,787085939,"Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,” according to the arrest warrant."
2943,787085939,"At no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what “verbal commands” she gave."
2944,787085939,"What’s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder—not Jean."
2945,787085939,Attempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who’d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.
2946,787085939,"What’s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment—implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start."
2947,787085939,"“From the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I’m thinking that I’m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,” Attorney Daryl Washington said."
2948,787085939,"“Well, the very first thing that I’m going to do is I’m not going to go outside and look at my address?"
2949,787085939,I’m going to give them my address right there on the phone.
2950,787085939,I’m going to say I’m on the phone.
2951,787085939,My address is this.
2952,787085939,Why did she have to go outside to verify the address?
2953,787085939,It makes no sense whatsoever.”
2954,787085939,"Even more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger’s story of inserting the key into Jean’s door and it opening up was simply not true."
2955,787085939,"According to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean’s door, demanding he let her in."
2956,787085939,"“Independent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,” Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News."
2957,787085939,“The contradictions begin to build from there.”
2958,787085939,The doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.
2959,787085939,This was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times—showing that it closed every single time—blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.
2960,787085939,Jean’s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean’s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.

2974,738542398,"IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan."
2975,738542398,"As Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime."
2976,738542398,"As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees."
2977,738542398,"Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah."
2978,738542398,"Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations."
2979,738542398,"The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane."

3004,794344513,The purge happened around 12:30 p.m. CST with mainstream news reports launching at the same time — implying that they were given the heads up about the move.
3005,794344513,"In a statement co-authored by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher — who Caitlin Johnstone aptly points out, also happens to be the former White House National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Policy — the massive social media platform explained that it has removed “559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”"
3006,794344513,"Facebook said the pages were “working to mislead others about who they are, and what they are doing.” However, this couldn’t be further from the truth."
3007,794344513,"Our names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles."
3008,794344513,"“We were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet."
3009,794344513,"They have seen our “Articles of Organization” which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co-founder lives,” Jason Bassler, co-founder of the Free Thought Project explained."
3010,794344513,"However, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge — elections are coming — and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore — like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh’s disdain for the Constitution."
3011,794344513,"“Given the activity we’ve seen — and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections — we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,” Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked “people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.”"
3012,794344513,It should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web — this is the very definition of grassroots.
3013,794344513,But all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play.
3014,794344513,"Within all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers."
3015,794344513,Does Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page?
3016,794344513,"We also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out."
3017,794344513,The only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves.
3018,794344513,"All but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well."
3019,794344513,They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension.
3020,794344513,“This signifies a re-consolidation of the media.
3021,794344513,"Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves."
3022,794344513,"This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation."
3023,794344513,Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.
3024,794344513,"So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,” John Vibes poignantly noted."
3025,794344513,The bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information-controlling establishment.
3026,794344513,We challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side.
3027,794344513,"There are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the “they are private, they can do what they wish” argument moot."
3028,794344513,"Facebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank — a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government — to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo."
3029,794344513,"The entity that is making censorship decisions for Facebook, as publicly announced, is the Atlantic Council, a partly US government-funded entity."

3053,782448403,"A federal judge on Monday issued a preliminary injunction continuing a prohibition on the Trump administration proposal to make available blueprints for so-called ghost guns, untraceable weapons that can be manufactured on a 3D printer, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said."
3054,782448403,California was one of 20 states led by Washington that won the decision from U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik in Seattle.
3055,782448403,The injunction extends a ruling last month that barred the Trump administration from taking steps that would allow the firm Defense Distributed to disseminate 3D gun blueprints.
3056,782448403,"“When the Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns, it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” Becerra said in a statement."
3057,782448403,“The Trump Administration’s actions were dangerous and incompetent.”
3058,782448403,The action Monday keeps in place a July 31 court decision blocking the Trump administration pending a decision on the merits of a lawsuit by states opposed to the blueprints being published.
3059,782448403,"“The Court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants’ First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the States are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,” Lasnik wrote in his decision."

3085,783774960,Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death.
3086,783774960,Gallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence.
3087,783774960,All five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court.
3088,783774960,The U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition.

3096,783774960,"“The criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,” the bureau said."

3118,783774960,"I mean someone who is serious about justice, not political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity."
3119,783774960,"Until then, I'll consider this the means the FBI will use to engage in the further coverup of what really took place at that compound beyond the bulldozing of a crime scene, and possibly, their own complicity."

3122,776385494,"CHICAGO - A US gun rights advocate began gearing up for a legal fight Wednesday to be able to publish online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms, as the White House signaled support for a federal judge's decision to block the venture."
3123,776385494,"Eight US states and the District of Columbia have argued in court that the blueprints available online to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons like this single-shot ""Liberator"" handgun could fall into the wrong hands"
3124,776385494,"Cody Wilson's Texas-based company Defense Distributed had briefly made the blueprints available online, but Seattle-based US District Judge Robert Lasnik granted an injunction Tuesday to take the material down."
3125,776385494,"The Donald Trump administration last month gave permission for Wilson to publish the blueprints, but the White House said Wednesday the president was unaware of the decision and was glad it was being reviewed."
3126,776385494,"Eight US states and the District of Columbia sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons."
3127,776385494,"Wilson complied with the judge's order, but put out a call for financial support for the legal battle ahead, including a scheduled August 10 court hearing."
3128,776385494,"He told CBS News ahead of the injunction that he believes ""access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity."
3129,776385494,"It's a fundamental human right."""
3130,776385494,"""What I'm doing is legally protected,"" he said."
3131,776385494,"""I will go to the appellate level."
3132,776385494,I will go to the Supreme Court.
3133,776385494,"I will waste all my time."""
3134,776385494,- President 'glad' for review -
3135,776385494,"As uproar was building Tuesday over Wilson's efforts, the president tweeted that making plastic 3D-printed guns publicly available ""doesn't seem to make much sense."""
3136,776385494,"White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated Wednesday, saying the administration's Justice Department had acted on its own in granting Wilson permission to publish the blueprints on his Defcad website -- settling a five-year legal battle."
3137,776385494,"""The Department of Justice made a deal without the president's approval,"" Sanders said."
3138,776385494,"""The president's glad this effort was delayed to give more time to review the issue."""
3139,776385494,Sanders also repeated the administration's claim from a day earlier that existing law already prohibits plastic firearms.
3140,776385494,"The National Rifle Association, the nation's most politically influential gun rights group, echoed that claim, contending that the 1988 law made the current 3D-printed gun issue moot."
3141,776385494,"""Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,"" the NRA said in a statement."
3142,776385494,"But Wilson has gotten around the legal prohibition by providing instructions with the digital files for 3D printing his ""Liberator"" plastic gun that call for an approximately six-ounce block of steel to be affixed to the weapon."
3143,776385494,"Should those who print the gun follow those instructions, metal detectors would pick up the weapons, thus complying with the law."
3144,776385494,"But while users can build the gun, there is no way to ensure they affix metal to it."
3145,776385494,- 'The debate is over' -
3146,776385494,"Late Tuesday, dozens of Democratic senators introduced legislation to prohibit the publication of 3D-printable firearm designs, a move gun control groups applauded."
3147,776385494,But some damage was already done.
3148,776385494,Wilson's blueprints had been posted on Defcad before the court order took effect and had already been downloaded thousands of times.
3149,776385494,"""The debate is over."
3150,776385494,The guns are downloadable.
3151,776385494,"The files are in the public domain -- you cannot take them back,"" Wilson told CBS."
3152,776385494,"Gun control groups nevertheless were relieved by the judge's decision, with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calling 3D-printed firearms ""nothing short of a menace to society."""
3153,776385494,"""There is simply no way of telling how much damage has already been done by Cody Wilson's dangerous and reckless actions,"" Brady Campaign co-president Kris Brown said in a statement."
3154,776385494,"""This is a strong step and a clear victory for the entire gun safety movement, but we simply can't let up."""
3155,776385494,"Prior to last month, Wilson had actually been losing his drawn-out legal battle, after both a federal district court and an appellate court ruled against him."
3156,776385494,The US Supreme Court declined to take up his case.
3157,776385494,"But in a sign of his determination to continue the legal fight, a message on the Defense Distributed website made a public appeal for financial support ""to uncensor the site."""
